 Disturbing, effective film	8MM is a very dark, disturbing film that isn't for everyone. Nicolas Cage puts in an excellent performance as a private detective named Tom Welles who is hired to investigate whether a snuff film is real or acted.  His journey takes him farther and farther into the realm of pornography. Every minute of this film is suspenseful and riveting.  I also found Joaquin Phoenix's performance to be outstanding as well.  This movie does a wonderful job of creating a dark mood and exploring the motives and drives behind its characters.  One of Cage's best, and a severely under-rated film.	8
 A dark, graphic view into the underworld of pornography		8
 Disturbing subject matter, yet a great film!		9
 Well made, but disturbing. Watch with care.	"I walked into the movie theater last Friday not expecting at all what I was about to see. I'd heard about it, thought ""Oh, another Seven"". Same screenwriter, but I was way off track. I can stomach a lot, having no problem stuffing down popcorn during very graphic scenes. In 8MM, my coke had trouble going down. 8MM did not have consistent gory/violent scenes, but the way the movie was made made you fill in the blanks of what the makers of the movie could not screen. And if you pay attention and immerse yourself, you fill in more blanks than you really think you could, or want. As Max put it: ""the devil changes you."" The perversity and deep rottenness of the human minds displayed in 8MM is what disturbs you. Then you realize, that ""snuff""-movies are real, that there are individuals twisted enough to endorse/enjoy/take part in it. And worst of all, that these individuals don't look like monsters, they're perhaps just overweight nearsighted men who look like your dad, your son, your brother, even yourself. And if you don't look out,(no matter how secluded you think you are in your suburban home, with a wife, a daughter, and a dog named Shep) you dive into the pit of perversion and rottenness as well, finding no way out. In conclusion: excellent music, acting very sufficient, the plot: a must see. Just don't bring popcorn, and prepare to walk out of the movie theatre disturbed, asking questions, and a little bit more suspicious of those walking around you, and yourself."	
 An Voyeuristic Thriller About Human's Capacity For Evil		8
 Not for the faint of heart		7
 Schumacher's best work	In the list of my 10 preferred films 8MM occupies the fifth place. This film is simply perfect. To begin the music is excellent, it contributes to give an at the same time sad, strange and beautiful particular environment. Then the actors whose initially Nicolas Cage are all very talented, especially Joaquin Phoenix and James Gandolfini. The scenario writer Andrew Kevin Walker who had largely proved reliable with Se7en did an extraordinary work. But what I enjoyed me the most in this film it is that there is a morals. In its investigation Nicolas Cage tests each minute more and more compassion for the wildly assassinated young girl whom it ends up making the decision not only to find all the authors of the snuff but of all to kill them.That's what I call a hero. This film is not on violence or sadomasochism but on the punishment. If in the true life each time that a snuff is carried out all passed as in 8MM,it would be a large thing.For me it is the best film of Schumacher which is at all events one of the largest realizers of the world. 10/10	10
 Very gritty and dark		8
 One of best movies I have seen	"8MM is one of best movies I have seen. Nicolas Cage plays his role very good, which I expected having seen ""Lord or War ""recently. The plot is interesting and so are the dialogs between characters. There are quite a few tense moments in the movie  which is probably why I liked this movie that much.Again trough it is only a movie as someone may say  it shows you a bit of the reality out there- the one which people don't want to admit that it exists. The movie is basically a mystery with some action elements. My opinion is that its rating on IMDb should be much higher  but well I guess not everyone likes movies like this one  trough I wonder why since there are many other movies that are much harder to watch than this one.One of the best things about 8 MM is its soundtrack honestly it is rare to find such a carefully chosen music to go with the scenes."	8
 Beware Of Brutal Topic	"Wow, this is a tough subject but not as sordid a film as I figured it would be, although be warned the last 30 minutes are really rough in spots. Speaking of spots, this is a bloody movie in spots, too and very profane after the first 40 minutes. Yet, despite the unpleasant nature of the story (making a ""snuff film"" - filming the killing of people) it's a riveting one, well-acted and doesn't overdo the violence. The characters in here are some of the most despicable you could find - killer and porn kings.Even our hero here, played by Nicholas Cage, starts off as a clean-cut fairly straight dude, and changes for the worst, too. Joaquin Phoenix has a good line in here, with the prophetic statement, ""The devil doesn't change; he changes you.""James Gandolfini and Peter Stormare play characters about as bad you'll ever find in a movie. This film is not, as they say, for all tastes. It will turn off a lot of people but it is interesting and good revenge story, if you like that sort of thing and know what you're in for before watching this."	6
 A Haunting and disturbing Brilliant Realistic Masterpiece!!	The intensely intriguing storyline of 8MM follows the haunting search by a private investigator (played superbly by Nicolas Cage) for the makers of a grotesque and disturbing snuff film in which a young woman is murdered. Starting by looking through endless missing persons files (in an attempt to identify the victim), Cage ultimately follows leads to the world of underground seaze films and the people who are involved in making them. Throughout his creepy investigation, Cage becomes more and more disturbed by the Snuff film and stops at nothing in an attempt to track down answers to what really happened.  This film is So intriguing and suspenseful, there are scenes that will leave your heart pounding in anticipation of what's to come.  I don't know if I have ever seen such an intriguing and suspenseful Drama/Thriller ever before!  This film is so realistic, there are times when you feel as if what is going on is real, and you begin to feel more for the characters than you usually do in a film.  The last 20 minutes of the film are heart pounding and breathtaking!  Director Joel Schumacher delivers one of the most mind haunting dramas you will ever see and gives us a story that won't be easy to forget.  It's dark, moody, creepy, brilliant, and disturbing!  And when all the pieces finally come together, you'll be glad you went along for the ride.  Wow, It's a sick world we live in!!  I give this movie 4 out of 4 stars!	
 A solid thriller!	"Some sensitive-minded people may surely be disturbed by the dark revenge and self-justice in this film, but ""Se7en""-author Andrew Kevin Walker has done another fine work with his script! Although the storyline is obviously taken from Paul Schrader´s ""Hardcore"" (1974,?) the film is suspense-packed, violent and endowed with good performances of its actors, especially Peter Stormare did a brilliant job with playing the weird bondage-porn director Dino Velvet! I also was truly surprised how good director Joel Schumacher had created a morbid atmosphere, just in unhappy memory of his disastrous ""Batman & Robin""-flick..! Another pleasant fact is, that ""8MM"" doesn´t deal with the Hollywood-typical stereotypes and clichés, so finally we´ve got something we could really call a dirty mainstream production - or at least a nice try of it!"	7
 Fantastic!!	8MM was a very dark and powerful film featuring the seedy underground world of pornography and snuff movies. It was, to be frank, fantastic. Nic Cage, rapidly becoming one of my favourite actors, walks through with a disgusted air and even Joaquin Phoenix, who I've never been that impressed with, hit the nail as a porn shop managerDeeply disturbing, yes. Highly compelling, yes. A good buy... you bet!	8
 Not A Fun Friday Night Movie, but....	"There are some movie's that i like to watch over and over again, with friends or by myself to relax. This is not one of those movie's, i have seen it all the way through exactly once and i don't intend on renting it any time in the near future. I still gave it a high rating though because it is such a powerful film, it screwed with my head and made me think, i don't always do that with film, most of the time i just like to relax, which is why this is not one of those movies i like to watch over and over again, still, a very well made movie and worth a look if one is in the mood for a disturbing, renching, powerful ""think film""."	10
 A similar formula....		8
 Gitty, Disturbing.....FANTASTIC	Eight millimeter is a gritty and disturbing look into the world of underground illegal pornography with a wonderful performance from the supporting cast including James Gandolfini(the sopranos) who play's a sleazy porn star agent, and Peter Stormare(Fargo) a twisted pornographer with the delusion of artistic genius. the film to say the least is fantastic but certainly not for the easily offended or faint hearted. starting with the discovery of a snuff film in a deceased business mans secret safe, a private investigator portrayed by Nicholas Cage(Raising Arizona)goes on a physically and emotionally draining journey to find out the authenticity of the film and who was involved in its production definitely a film that has to be seen to be truly appreciated i suggest not watching it to late at night. i give this film a definite 8.5 out of ten.Gritty, Disturbing and fantastic, definitely take a shower after watching this.	6
 Underrated and controversial, yet classic to be		8

 Engaging the first time round ***possible spoilers***	"I saw this movie one and two halves times. I bought the VCD just to see Joaquin Phoenix as Max California. I said two halves because after the first viewing ""8MM"" is about as exciting as a Maths exam. I can't even sit through this movie for a few more times for my favourite actor (Phoenix). Having said that, ""8MM"" is one of my favourites. Firstly, it introduced me to the great talent that Phoenix is. Secondly, it made me think long and hard about the perversity in human beings. And what I thought about made me sad, but nevermind. Third, I truly enjoyed it when I saw it on HBO. I can't deny that. ""8MM"" doesn't make me feel dirty, it doesn't excite me *that* way, it *didn't* bore me...it just made me sad. Granted, Joel Schumacher doesn't seem to know where he's heading, and the ending was kind of stupid. Nicolas Cage could have been better, but then, he could have been worse. The whole movie seems terribly messed up...but hey, isn't that what the pornographic world is? Terribly messed up?**possible spoilers**Amy Morton was absolutely wonderful as the stressed out mother. She had me sympathising with her, and among so many messed up characters she is the one I remember the most. Along with Max California, who was excellently portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, who seems to have a way of changing his voice for his roles. Like many other users have said Max was the only comic relief in the movie. It was quite tragic and stupid on the script writers' part what happened to him. Phoenix played Max's last scene with such terrifying realism, it was painful to watch. (According to Schumacher on the DVD though Phoenix *really* -became- Max. He wasn't acting there, he was truly terrified of the other actors.) That guy who played Dino was also good, in fact almost every cast member was good, except Catherine Keener who annoyed me terribly and, sadly, Nicolas Cage, who looked like he was sleepwalking through half of it. But then again like I've said before, he could have been worse. So now do I really need to reinforce my opinion that Joaquin Phoenix is the best thing since sliced bread, and he was the best thing in ""8MM""?""8MM"" is definitely a dark movie, but on the other hand its darkness makes it realistic. Because what  happens to Mary Anne is something I see happening right now. That is the sadness of it, that and the fact that normal people like you and me (like Machine) are twisted enough to want to make people suffer because ""they can""."	9
 A lovely spiral into the underworld of human desire.	I absolutely loved this movie!  It is dark and spinister and dives into the outer reaches of porn where very few people feel safe to wonder.  It is one of the best pictures that i have seen in years.  Nicolas Cage and the Pheniux boy are very good actors and bring into the movie two very interesting and diverse characters.	10
 Festering		7
 Dark and disturbing, yes, but it should also be clearly noted that 8MM avoids, for the most part, the almost always destructive influence of Hollywood.		8
 Disquieting but effective for mature audiences. *** out of ****.		7
 One Of Schumacher's Better Efforts.		7
 Brilliant film, but disturbing in some places	Incredible film, picking up the box I never thought it would be about this (I don't normally read the back of boxes as it spoils it for me). The disturbing bits were some of the pornographic scenes and the pornographic violence scenes that were shown during the movie. However it was a very enjoyable and gripping film that I throughly enjoyed. I recommend this to you as a midnight-thriller (as such), but I do warn that it is a long film so best so stock up on snacks before watching. I give 9/10 for the brilliant performance of Cage and the excellent screen play & script quality. This film also has excellent music that keeps the suspense and the moment going. As a final note, the film does contain some blood, gore and horror and some very disturbing films. This film is not suitable for young.	9
 near masterpiece	"if it wasn't for some of the TV movie style cheesiness at the end, this movie would be a dark noir masterpiece. The performances are so brilliant - this is Cage's best performance, and I'm a fan of Nic. Joaquin is fabulously real as a porno store worker. The cinematography - wow - Gordon Willis esquire. The writing - the last line of this movie is ""Save Me"". Every goosebump on your skin just went up. Cage's concern for the girl is so haunting and believable. There are parts of this movie that are 100% about Joel Schumacher about being unflinchingly honest about man's capacity to get turned on by the dark side and his struggle with that that is so non-Hollywood, non-sanitized and non-preachy. If you liked Silence of the Lambs NOT because Tony Hopkins was sooooo creepy but because it exposed honestly a dark underworld - Buffalo Bill, etc, you will be drawn to this film. Cage's empathy, acting as a conduit for Joel, I found to be deeply moving. I have a hard time understanding why people have such contempt for this movie. My guess is that they are in denial about their own dark temptations."	9
 leave it out Son!	I have no idea why this movie has been given such a low rating to date.the story line is totally unique, the performances are exceptional!the sound track was also the (one of the) first to adopt the 'arabic' thing.if you don't have a Scooby Doo (clue) what i'm talking about, then you have nothing to loose by spending an evening cuddled up on the sofa watching this GREAT movie	10
 It got to me. Dark, with minimum theatrical gestures.	"Warning: The following includes some details about the movie plot!This movie got to me. You get immersed in the dark and gloomy atmosphere in an honest way, that takes the sting out of the (arguably) ""happy"" ending. I just finished watching it, and I feel it will not go away from my mind now, for a while, like Se7en, which still haunts me from time to time (and which was dark in a similar way, not because of some graphic images).One very good scene is when Tom is pointing a gun at Eddie's head. What do you make of Eddie's behavior in that scene? Does he mean it when he says he wants Tom to end his misery (remorse?)? Is his sarcasm really the words of a frightened man with a gun to his head, or a desperate attempt to still detach himself from the murder of a young girl, which Tom had made him relive?"	10

 Dark,disturbing,thrilling... and for that worth a watch!	I really liked 8mm. Didn't know much about the film in 1999, nor had i seen the trailer, nor had anyone told me about this film. That is the best way to go into a movie; nothing is present beforehand to put you off viewing the film or over hype its quality. And it paid off. This movie has good, grounded characters (Cage as a detective investigating the origin of a snuff film and Phoenix playing a sidekick type character helping him); an interesting and thrilling plot and additionally for me, an ending that i was satisfied with. And that is so important! I know Joel Schumacer has done some terrible films in the past like Batman and Robin, but this one is filmed well, paced well and is definitely worth a watch once or twice again. It's very dark, disturbing and has some great twists.My score = 8/10	8
 A beautiful statement that goes nowhere	I was struck by how poignant this film portrays itself to be. Yes, it's dark, dirty, and disturbing, but underneath all of that there is an incredible statement on our lives. We catch a glimpse of this in a few scenes, but it can never seem to break through. It feels like this film is on the verge of something really great, but ends up dwelling in the disgusting underworld of porn and snuff. This world is so horrible that the light can't find it's way through. No matter how you feel about 8mm, it will make you think and effect you in some way.It builds to a very intense climax, but continues on only to end flat on it's face. Although not a great film, 8mm may be an important one, and one that should be seen. **1/2/****	8
 Dark and Thrilling		10
 Amazingly different	8mm has once again proved, how committed an actor Nicholas Cage is, to have chosen to act in movies like this. Its so gripping and pulsating, I wonder how it got a rating less than 7 - it deserves much better. First of all its breaks a lot of Hollywood cliches and then it embarks on a totally different path, that it leaves you spell bound and asking for more.Credit should go to director Joel Schumacher, for having made a bold and well-made movie like this. Its a MUST watch for anyone who likes suspense movies with a touch of class. If you are yet to watch it, be ready come face to face with some ugly realities and hypocrisy in this society and come out with a sense of guilt. Don't miss this movie.	9
" Disturbing Images and Atmosphere, Plus Strong Acting from Nicholas Cage, Anthony Heald, and James Gandolfini, Highlight "" 8MM """		
 Disturbing and eye opening	After seeing this movie in the video store, me and my friend decided to borrow it thinking it might be interesting. By the time we'd finished watching it a whole new side of society had opened up and revealed itself to me. The story is simple- a private eye, hired by an old lady to find out the truth behind a film she found in her deceased husbands safe that shows a young girl being murdered on film- is the murder real? Who were the men who perpetrated the crime? And so begins the journey into a side of society we rarely see, let alone believe exists, a journey that is both dark and disturbing but almost true. It makes you wonder, do you know your friends as well as you'd like to. Is there something that there hiding. Do they have a side that we'd dismiss as fiction? Although this movie isn't gory or graphic(except for one scene) it still has the power to shock you with its images and themes that run through the film. The way Nicholas Cage's character changes is entirely believable. I mean wouldn't you change if you went from being a family man with a happy, one sided view to life, to a man who has been corrupted by a world he never knew existed? Overall a brilliant study of the human character and the many faces a person can have. You have been warned though this movie is very disturbing and should not be watched alone (or if you have a weak stomach) 9/10	
 Extremely Intense and Disturbing	"Really deserving of an NC-17 rating, ""8mm"" reminded me of George C. Scott's descent into sleaze (or Hell?) and depravity in ""Hardcore"". Hired by a rich widow to investigate an alleged  snuff film found in her late husband's safe, Cage embarks on a tawdry odyssey into the hellish environment of the lowest levels of the pornography and S&M industry - and the darker impulses within his own formally smug self long kept hidden. The menace and danger is palpable throughout. Cage's performance is quite good and convincing. The film itself has logical problems: five people get murdered in this plot, yet not once are the police involved or even a concern. But this is not a fatal flaw by any means. Some people will dislike the subject matter intensely, and thus rate the movie lower than they should. I found it compelling throughout; I sure wasn't bored.  Recommended!"	9
 Darker than the bat...	"8mm is an excellent film, highly underrated and dismissed by way too many people. Well acted, and despite what people have said, well directed. It's quite refreshing to see a detective in a film actually do any detecting, as opposed to the standard Hollywood convention of having our hero get a lead through a snitch or a coincidence. You genuinely feel in this film that the detcetive has earned his trade, and deservedly works his way up through a chain of people until he meets the person responsible for the snuff film. The film is dark, and our imagination is left to run riot, and this can be disturbing. The basement scene where the pornography is for sale is bad enough already without one of the signs on the stalls reading, ""Kids."" Some finely timed set peices towards the end, and a cathartic climax for our hero, this is a slow burning film that will stay in the memory for a long long time."	10
 Terrifying Good	I didn't know what to expect of this movie but I knew Nicolas Cage was playing in it so it couldn't be bad and it would be packed with action. Afterwards I needed a few minutes to catch my breath. The movie was not packed with action but it was so full of emotion. It was not the suspense of the movie that caught my attention but it was the beastly the crime that took my attention. It seemed very realistic to me, the move was no fiction to me. It could be caught out of real life. I just hope it will never happen to me or someone I love. I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did a few minutes afterwards.	
 Under Rated dark film		9
 Watch if you dare!!	"""8MM"" might very well be Nick Cage's best role to date. Joel Schumacher's new film ""8mm"" is a dark, violent and dreary journey into the underground world of snuff films. What is a snuff film? I will get that in a min. However, this film is not for the faint of heart and surprisingly has a satisfying but strange conclusion. Thorugh the extreme violence, there is a story to be told about a world you may not know about. Snuff films are pornographic films that depict actual murder. Pretty edgy stuff right?It's about a private investigator, Tom Welles (Nick Cage) who is hired by the lawyer of a wealthy elderly lady who has found an apparent snuff film on 8MM in a safe belonging to her recently deceased husband. Tom is tasked with discovering why the film was in the safe and if the events depicted in the film are real or not. With, Max California (Joaquin Phenoix) as his guide, he descends on a dangerous journey into a seedy world to uncover the truth about the film and discover something he never knew existed.There is no question that some audiences will be appalled by this film. It's very HARD R rated as it should be but surprisingly didn't get an NC-17 for the subject matter. However, there is a real story to be told here, and the purpose of the film is to take an everyday character and plunge him into a world of evil, depravity and disturbing behavior. No doubt this world does exist but it's not tame, and the film has a foreboding and cringy worth sense to it that lets you know director Joel Schumacher is not hiding the reality of this world. Some of the material is brutal and hard to watch but the excitement of it is something you have never seen before with morality unforgotten, and Schumacher doesn't make the film an excuse for exploitation but rather a movie about consequences for stepping into the unknown.Tom Welles specializes in surveillance for high-level clients and spends his days mostly tailing after adulters'. Would you think that would get boring after a while? He is a family man and seems to enjoy what he does for a living. It opens with Tom being asked to come to the house of the elderly woman where he is informed that the task at hand will be something new for him if he chooses to accept. The 8MM film discovered in the safe is pornographic in nature and depicts a young woman apparently being murdered, and the widow wants the reassurance from Tom that she didn't really die. Welles informs her of Snuff Films - ""What your describing is a snuff film. Basically Urban Legends - makeup, special effects."" After viewing the film, Welles decides to accept and tells her ""If she was killed, her killers are not going to be easy to track down.""You get the sense that Los Angeles has a brooding side to it that seems unknown to a lot of people. At least that is the way I have always seen L.A. as and the film suggests that I am right as it is the place to be for young thrill seekers. Although, that's not still a good thing because they may get more than they bargained for. Enter Max California who works in porn retail and becomes intrigued at the idea of Welles investigating a snuff film. Through Max, Tom meets lowlife, Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini) who leads them to a vicious porn director, Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare) and the star of his films, Machine (Chris Bauer) who never takes off his mask. I was surprised at how it ended and what I saw under the Machine's mask. These three weirdos might just be the killers Welles is looking for but how far will they drive Tom to the edge?One of the more brutal scenes depicted in the film aside from the dirty and dark atmospheric setting along with the graphic images of the explicit movies being played on TV's is when Welles has a chance to get revenge on one of the killers but lacks the willpower (he's not a killer). Instead, he asks questions he needs answers for because Welles has been driven to the point where he feels like he could kill when he discovers true evil does exist in the world. The scene shows where the setting of the snuff film took place and one of the killers describes how it was done before he is viciously assaulted. We expect Wells to put himself in danger asking questions and venturing into the world of pornographers for hire, and he does, but the film also shows the sociopathic nature of someone who has no moral conscience and the audience is let to deal with that.You might think you can figure out the ending of the film, but I was actually surprised when one of the killers is revealed, and he is not what I expected. It makes you wonder what runs through the killer's mind when he says ""I do it because I like it."" To a sane person, the question is why? That person is Tom Welles. For everything the film is worth, it touches on subject matter that may be risque but in the end, provides a story into the unknown that you may or may not want to know might actually exist. It also asks the question, If you were in Tom Welles shoes, how would you deal with all of this after everything is said and done?"	9
 a really good film	i first watched this film in 1999, as i am a big fan of joaquin phoenix, and to tell the truth i expected it to be rubbish, as i had heard really bad reviews of it, but when i watched it, within the first 20mins i thought this is a really good film, even though i dont really like nic cage he gave a very good performance as the private dective hired to find out the truth of a snuff film, where a girl is killed, which takes him down a road that gets more and more dangerous, and meeting lots of different people including max california, (joaquin phoenix)who works in a sex shop and gives the best performance in the film. i would give this film 10/10 a really good film.	
 An awe inspiring work from the writer of Seven	"This was an exceptional piece of work from the man who brought us ""Seven"". I was a bit skeptical when I saw that Joel Schumacher was the director, but he didn't ruin the film.  This is an excellent film that I would recommend anyone to go see."	10
" The film asks the question you may not want to answer, ""How far would you go?"""	"This film shows the gritty side of the porno film industry. If you thought ""Boogie Nights"" showed the seamier side of the industry, this goes far beyond that. It goes to the underbelly where, I'm sure, most ""legitimate"" pornographers would not care to let you know their industry goes. However, that is not where the real story lies. The story attempts to make you ask yourself the question, ""How far would you go?"" The film gives constant contrasts to the light and dark side of our behavior, not only through the dialogue, but also the film itself goes from a very dark hue, to very bright several times, showing the dichotomy in all of our lives, or at least our thinking process. I recommend the film for those viewers who want to think about the questions it raises. Also, visually,  it did not delve as deeply into the violent nature of porno as it could have, and I applaud the director for that decision. It did more with good editing (credit the editor for that) than with actual visual exploitation. The ending was pretty much what you would expect, but it couldn't have ended otherwise and been a film based in reality. Go see it, but be prepared to do some ""self-introspection."""	7
 It is not bad!	"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** First of all this movie is not as disturbing many people tell. If you take a look at se7en, angel heart or silence of the lambs, 8mm can't compared in ways of intensivity or how disturbing it was. There are of course some hard scenes in it, but they are personal to the viewers. The second thing I want to mention is that, the immaskation (don't know if that's a word) of maschine is just great! -Spoilers!- He is just a stupid, poor, fat boy. That is really clever I think, because it's a serious way to deal with that kind of topic insteat of wanting to scare people. Ok, what people can critisize is the way ""Cage"" asks for the right to murder maschine. If he hab murdered him just directly it would have been ok for some reason, but noone can should get the legitimation to kill another. -Spoilers end!- Overall a good movie. 7/10"	
 Contemporary film-noir at its darkest	Nicholas Cage has played disturbed, hole-in-the-souled charactersbefore, but he had really reached a whole new level of dark in 8MM. In it, he plays Tom, a PI who has had it good thanks to a loving wife and a newborn baby daughter. His happy life takes a swerve when he is hired to find out if a snuff-porn film is authentic or not. His journey takes him to a myriad of cooky characters and false ends that somewhere along the line, he lost track of reality himself. Totally bizarre and disturbing, 8MM definitely has a solid grasp on the viewer. He (or she) can't help but feel sympathetic for Tom even after he took a dive into the abyss. I wouldn't be a bit surprised if the role gave Cage himself a jolt of the senses; makes me wonder if this is the reason why he did a heart-warming tear-jerker like THE FAMILY MAN a year following 8MM!	
 Possible spoilers, so don't say I didn't warn you	I had heard bad reports about this film(bad guys were over the top, cliched as hell) but the film I saw was perfectly directed, had a brilliant role for Nicolas Cage and James(Tony Soprano)Gandolfini was superb as ever.Ignore the critics and watch this,almost,masterpiece	7
 A paradox of sorts.		
 Great!	8MM is one of the best crime dramas I've seen in a while.  The story is so engrossing that you watch it from start to finish, and it never drags for one instant.  The violence in the film is gruesome, but done so tastefully that you think you see more than you actually do.  The cinematography was excellent, in addition to the ways in which the shots were lined up.  The culture and tone displayed in the movie is truly disturbing, and will make even the sickest pervert think twice about his or her desires. Rating: 10/10	
 wow- this was one of the best movies of the year.	Basically, I think cage is a decent actor at best.  This movie, however, he plays his role to its fullest.  The setting is just dark, and the happenings in this movie are kind of scary to think about, because it has probably happened for real somewhere.	9
" ""snuff""antastic, but it's good"	"When you think back at ""8Mm"", what comes to your mind first is the depressing feeling you get during the whole movie. Joel Schumacher manages to create a special atmosphere: he uses pale colors, it's dark or rain almost all the time. Just like it's needed for a movie with a pretty original subject: snuff movies. Real or not? Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) is hired to investigate if a snuff movie, in which a young girl is brutally murdered, is authentic or not. Cage enters into a dark universe filled up with lunatics or psychos. He gets very involved in the case, and ends up doing things he never imagined being capable of. As Joaquin says, ""You can't change the devil. The devil changes you"". Still the movie is sometimes too slow and boring (in the first part). A subject like this could've had the result a way better movie, but this one's worth to watch. You'll not forget it easily and whenever you look back at it, you'll see darkness and madness. Vote: 7 out of 10."	7
 Cage steals the show ... again!	Joel Schumacher's brilliance comes through in an epic and yet disturbing tale of Nicolas Cage's quest to find out what has happened to a star of a 'snuff' movie.Cage is superb as the investigator, but you can also not give enough praise to Phoenix, who is superb as the adult bookstore proprietor who assists him in his quest.  In fact by the end of this film you are more disturbed then you are impressed by its excellence, but it is a must see all the same.	8
 A very underrated film.		7
 be disturbed!	Well,watching 8MM makes you squirm to say the least.I might admit it's as disturbing as Se7en.It's one of those films not aimed for box-office but intensifying our terror as being humans in a shattering way.Its dark intensity smolders you and lingers in your mind long after you watch it and keeps you thinking over it on occasions in this world of 'reality TVs'.Sorry,but this is not for the faint hearted,popcorn consuming average movie-goers(or devourers should I say)Thisfilm is for those who wants to be forewarned for human inadequacies,atrocitieshappening before our very 'watchful'eyes and consciousness.No hero but all villains.Watch this and be relentlessly disturbed.Very good film...	8
 Sick, buy 5 get one free.	"I waited a few weeks before adding my comments on this film. It really affected me for days afterward. I would wake up with this film on my mind. I think its a good film but I believe it could have been brilliant. The premise is excellent: a private detective is employed to find out the truth behind a snuff movie. So much could have been achieved by this film but the team making it sold out somewhere along the line ( maybe they did it for the money? ) As it stands Nick Cage does a better job than many people realise. The comment ""sleepwalked through his role"" has been levelled at Cage a bit but I think this is intended on his part and I don't think he makes any acting mistakes. He walks away from this film spotless. Max California is cool and when he and Cage are onscreen togeather its really enjoyable. The soundtrack is interesting - slightly jarring yes but I liked it. See this movie - its worth it - even if it sucks in places - it does make you think about the root of all evil. This film has done me good - I just wish it could have gone all the way."	
 Nic Cage gives a great Performance	Tom Welles a surveillance specialist who is called in to look at a film where a girl is murdered. Now he is on the hunt to find the people that are making these films.. and all of this takes him to the darkest places... I loved this movie because it had very exciting scenes in it and you never where sure what was going to happen next. Nicolas Cage gives an amazing performance in this dark thriller. A movie worth watching.	9
 Interesting, chilling, disturbing......	Wow. Thats all I can say about this one. 8MM is a good film (though I thought it did get a little silly towards the end) about the dark world of 'snuff' movies. Nic Cage is on top form, and Joaquin Phoenix gives the film an extra boost whenever he's on screen as the cool, streetwise Max. I think he should have been in it more, cos the two of them really had good chemistry. I didn't find it *very* disturbing, which is good I guess. It gives you a little bit of insight into the dark underworld of film making. I think my fave bit in the movie, is when Tom and Max are sat watching a 'snuff' movie, and are just sat there, their eyes fixed on the screen, with their hands over their mouths, disgusted at what they see. Brilliant acting from the fab-as-always Nic and sexy-fab-soon-to-be-huge-star Joaquin.....	
 Disturbing, wierd, good.	If you are planning on seeing 8MM, I will first say, it is not a happy movie.  This movie is very dark and ominous in nature.  I'm not the kind of guy that only watches dark, somber movies - If a person is stuck to only that genre they might end up being creepy and depressed themselves.  I like variety, though.  In 8MM, Nicholas Cage plays Tom Wells, a detective who is hired by a rich elderly woman to investigate a film she found in her dead husband's safe that depicts what apears to be a pornography bit but ends with the girl being murdered.  As Mr. Wells goes deeper into his case, he gets the assistance of Max California, an employee at an adult book store who turns out to be smarter than he appears.  Tom ends up going in over his head and delves deep into the dark underworld of pornography.  This movie has an excellent soundtrack that conveys the creepy sense even further. There are a few good comic relief scenes, which in a movie like this are usually welcomed.  This film has some good twists, and is very interesting. The actors do a good job in this film, especially Nicholas Cage.  Go see 8MM if you are in the mood for an interesting thriller with some twists and a dash of comedy.	
 Be prepared for a shock, but also for brilliance.		
 Very deep and intense		8
 Fairly grimy	This is a quite chilling film with a tendency to go a little over the top at times. Nicholas Cage is characteristically ghost-like in his portrayal of a man sucked into the world of fetishistic porn. On the whole it works as an intriguing thriller but not as an education in this subspeciality of sexual deviance.	6
 A Chilling movie about the darkest human perversions.	"As i have said before , Nicolas Cage only ever makes a good film or a bad one , no imbetween. Well this is a Cracker. 8mm is a Chilling movie about a private detective who is hired to find out if a girl is really killed in a so called "" Snuff"" movie.During the investigations the PI is shown the darkest side of American Pornographyand the sleezy horrible people involved. In the process of this he starts to neglect his own family and gets so caught up in the snuff scene that he wants revenge on the people who did it.Joel Schumacher directs this film brilliantly. Its not to over the top or graphic but just enough to feel for the people in the film.My only concern is that it was maybe 20 minutes too long. 8 out of 10."	8
 Hard MM		7
 A gut wrenching peak at the world of S&M.	A provoking script from Andrew Kevin Walker, directed by Joel Schumacher. An important politician has died. Going through his belongings, the widow finds a piece of tape. The tape depicts the rape and death of a young woman at the hands of a mysterious man dressed in S&M gear. Detective Tom Wells, played by Nicolas Cage, is urged to view the film and find out if it is real and was the dead politician really involved in its making.Your imagination goes to work with what the movie maker can't show you. And then you might have trouble with some of the scenes you do get to look at. Violent and perverse, but yet only a small glimpse at the darker side of life. Not just a cheap thrill. This thing will rattle your brain.Supporting cast includes Joaquin Phoenix, Christopher Bauer, Amy Morton and Catherine Keener.	7
 VERY DARK AND DISTURBING EVEN TO THE STRONG OF STOMACH	I love Nicholas Cage, but this movie is like a trip into a dark labyrinth. The very concept is disturbing, and I can't imagine anyone really enjoying this film unless they have sado-masochism in their character. I'm open minded.  I saw Se7en and liked it.  Pulp Fiction is one of my favorites, for godsakes.  But it's the fact that this kind of activity occurs on a daily basis in dark, cold, dank corners of our country that makes it real, and therefore very quietly horrifying.	
 Very good movie of its kind	"As usual Cage as actor and Schumacher as director come through with a winner.  This one is not for the squeamish of heart.  I have worked with Mr. Shumacher in the screening room on ""The Client"" and have personally observed his meticulous attention to his craft.  Once again he shows us the results of his special skills.  The writing helps make the picture what it is also. Danny Abbott"	10
 A dark and stormy journey, a thought provoking and unnverving movie.	An extremely disturbing film which makes you think you should really switch off, but you just can't, just like the feelings that swamp the main character, Nicholas Cage, as he watches the snuff movie for the first time. This film is filled with bad, rotten feelings and characters, and yet it's extremely compelling. Watching Tom Welles descend from urbanite father to sleazy hardcore, and beyond, watcher is unnerving. Cage plays both parts very well, he's a superb actor after all, combined with a great story and a team that creates the sleazy world of underground pornography so believably (so I understand anyway!), it makes for a stormy and dark ride.	8
 Real Life		10
 This movie is horrible... that's why I rated it 8	8mm does exactly what it was made to do, to disgust you. It shows how filty people can be, not that we didn't know already. But sometimes being, more or less, forced to put up with them for two full hours, leaves the mind to linger on that realization... at least a lot more than the pace of modern watch-listen-and-dump-out-of-our-way-too-busy-minds media would allow. All in all a daring movie. But I would have expected nothing less from the writer who showed that being a hero is not all fame and glory... and that sometimes you just have to change the tempo of your life.	8
 why the bad reviews?	"I just viewed the movie, and came right to the IMDB to see comments. I am surprised by the negativity. Many have dismissed this movie as predictable Hollywood fare. Others have said ""it's not really disturbing, just because it's about illegal porn."" Exactly how jaded are we now as a society that the subject matter isn't enough to be disturbing? Well, that's much more subjective - to my main point. I think Cage did a fine job of portraying a man on a mission to understand ""why?"" To me, this was the essence of the movie. I disagree with the assessment that there was an unexplainable shift to avenger. I didn't see it that way. I understood his motivation completely. I agree, ""Seven"" was fantastic, but just because this didn't top the shock of Seven doesn't mean it's somehow inferior. Cage far exceeds Pitt as a character actor (though I think Pitt is a great actor - too bad he's normally considered only for looks and not innate ability). Bottom line: I followed Cage's character throughout, and I understood and sympathized with every move. Maybe that says more about me than the film. Hmmm.."	9
 Thrilling, grabbing, well done motion picture	"Frankly saying, when i was gonna buy this movie, i did not expect too much from it just because it happened to me to read a review of it in a magazine. But i was surprised. On the whole it is a very god movie, by the way, far better than David Fincher's ""Se7en"", which is just a dark and boring, predictable film. But from the very beginning, 8mm is a gripping and shocking movie (but a little bit too long), very well photographed by Robert Elswit (The Hand That Rocks The Cradle). So, Joel Schumaher and Nicholas Cage manage to create an outstanding and scary movie."	
 I know people disagree, but this was a masterpiece	I know a lot of people who tell me I am crazy, but I think 8mm is a poweful, disturbing, masterpiece. It is a film that is not afraid to gross you out to make a point. It failed at the box office, due to it's subject matter, but it is a vastly underrated film that deserves more credit. it is not afraid to tell the truth about our society, and the darkest reaches of it. Even in the action sequences we see at the end, it doesn't forget that it is a film with a message.	
 different		7
 A good, solid thriller	Despite previous comments it is not boring, it does not have intrusive music, and it does not rain all the time (only once, I believe). If you want a rip-roaring all-action thriller then this is not it; if you want an intelligent, thought-provoking film about a private investigator (he was a PI wasn't he? He wasn't meant to be a ridiculously-muscled tough guy? I have been reading reviews for the same film?) then see this film. Surprisingly enough, in a film about a private investigator this bloke actually does some investigating, he doesn't just run about waving a gun in the air and hitting people (although he does do that too on occasion). This is not boring - it is actually (to my mind at least) far more interesting.This is not a perfect film. The scenes between Cage and his wife are liable to induce nausea (particularly, I would suspect, in Britain!), and Cage's performance is not great. But it's adequate, and Phoenix and the baddies are very good. Actually, I think I liked this film better than 'Seven' (if we must compare).	8
 The devil changes you		7
 A journey into a dark,grim, and yet revealing world.	This just doesn't seem to be a movie that strikes as good a chord with people as other recent movies. I suppose that's what I found so appealing. 8mm went deeper into both the subject matter and audience deeper than most movies would even look. My friends were disgusted. I sat quietly and thought to myself. The movie makes one think about just how dark the inside of a person can truly be. I seriously don't think you can walk away a little unchanged after viewing this movie. I want to hand out congratulations to Joel Schumacher and Nicholas Cage. One aspect I really enjoyed about the movie was the mood that Schumacher set. I notice that the deeper cage gets into the sado-masochistic plot, the darker the lighting gets. I don't suggest this movie for the weak-stomached, easily(or not so easily) offended, or on the first date.	9
 A Misunderstood Morality Tale		7
 a movie that will shock you ...	What would you do if you were at the place of the hero of that movie ? That's what I asked myself when I got out of the theater. It's really violent though not that obscene. What makes that movie worth seeing is all in the thinking that it might bring to the spectator.	7
 Devils changing you already.....	Tom Welles, private eye, is hired by a wealthy widow, whose well-known husband passed away recently.She has found a reel of S8-film in a safe. On the film is a cruel slaughtering of a young girl, who obviously does not pretend or act: A snuff-movie.Welles takes up investigation, which leads him to the girl's mother and from there to Hollywood, into the office of a porn flick producer.Welles' rising obsession to solve the case also carries him away from his wife and new-born daughter.But when finally names are at hand, Welles suddenly finds himself on ice much thinner than he planned......It's such a simple premise that has been expertly made by Schumacher (didn't thi8nk i'd say that again after batman), and an original move by Hollywood, having one of the most bankable stars (at the time) starring in something so sleazy, dark, and disturbing, that it could put off fans of Cage for life.The film is basically a retelling of Dantes Inferno. Welles descent into the dark side of life, experiencing this part of life, rather than just knowing about it from the comfort of his home.It's a difficult film to watch, knowing that normal everyday people get there kicks from watching stuff like this, and the rich deciding someones fate, just because they can. But this is te thing that shocks the most, normal everyday people, who are not bad guys, just business persons trying to make money, doing this, because they get paid.Walker gives us a great story, and Cage again puts in a flawless performance as the tortured Welles, knowing that this job won't ever be too far behind him.The rest of the cast are good, and Schumacher rewards us with some stunning set pieces, most notably at machines house near the end, where a vinyl record being stuck has never been more un-nerving. This film isn't for anyone, but if you read between the lines and don't take it as a standard thriller, you will find something dark and disturbing here.	9
 Intense journey into the depths of a desperate and violent counter-culture	"A loving family man is drawn into a violent and desperate counter-culture of drugs, sex and death.  Working as a private investigator trying to find the true fate of a young girl who appears to have been murdered in a ""snuff film"" he becomes more and more personally involved.  The dark feelings of self-loathing and defeat that drive a person into that lifestyle are beautifully presented in a way the can frighten and repel some, while being intimately familiar to others.  Either way, the intensity of the emotion will leave none untouched."	10
 Good but not brilliant!		8
 Good, solid mystery/thriller		7
 Buyer beware. Know what you're going to see & you won't be disappointed.	"I heard a lot of hype about how terrible and graphic this movie is. Of course like most of the public, when I hear something like that, then I have to see it for myself. I'm a believer that if you want to be critical, you have to see the movie first. And I'll try any movie at least once. For this movie once is enough, which is not to say that I regret seeing it. I believe people should be open to new experiences. This movie is basically a murder mystery. People keep comparing it to Seven, but as I've said in previous reviews, there's no point to comparing movies, they should be judged on their own merits. There are many reasons to see a movie, to be uplifted, to laugh, to learn, to be shocked, to be enobled. At the box office, there was a sign about 8MM saying, know what movie you are going to see, no refunds, graphic content. This is a movie that attempts to tell a story about a man's descent into his own horror when he discovers how far he is willing to go to find who murdered a young girl. He also discovers that he's willing to cross the rather fuzzy line between good & evil when he himself is faced with vengeance. Some of the movies best lines are delivered by Joaquin Phoenix. Especially in the realm of how evil and ugliness affect your soul. This movie *is* affecting & ugly, but not in a pointless way. It is admittedly a ""slice of life"" that few of us would seek to see or enjoy, but is nevertheless, there. If you're not the type to like seeing the under belly of society, don't go see a movie about it. This movie was tastefully done, if that can be said about a movie where much of the time is spent seeking porno movies of people being killed. In all events, know what you're going to see & you won't be disappointed."	6
 The Nature of Evil	"The first thing I'll say is that I felt like taking a shower after watching this movie. Then I resolved to stop watching black-as-night movies like this. Then I admitted that I found the movie to be unique and bracing. There are so many movies out there that revel in violence and mayhem, and treat the impulse for revenge almost as a virtue. This is not such a movie. Tom Wells, played superbly by Nicolas Cage, is given a simple, but lucrative, private eye job - determine the veracity of what appears to be a snuff film, then go home to his wife and little girl (he's chosen because he's taken to be stupid, and not a troublemaker - wrong on both counts).You see, Wells has a conscience, and is a straight-arrow, middle-class guy. But the deeper he digs into the underbelly of the sex industry, the more horrified he becomes by what he uncovers, and the more sympathy he develops for the teen-aged ""star"" of the film in question. Then, violent reactions are aroused, and he plunges into the grotesque maelstrom of this world he probably barely noticed in his nice, safe life.I ponder the news, and I don't even want to imagine the horrors of sex-slavery and child-molestation, but I know these things have permeated our society, that women, as in this film, are dehumanized as ""pussy"". And what kind of men are they who are the customers, the ""johns"", the pimps, the purveyors? Their victims are real people, however naive they are, but here they are mere commodities. We're used to evil being presented, as in horror films, as something unhuman, outside of ourselves, but here it's all too human, all too mundane. Evil might be Joe the mechanic down the street. There's a scene in the film in which Wells is browsing the pornography in a deeply underground shop. He comes across a section labelled ""kids"", and a chill ran up my spine. I don't think that the film-makers were as interested in the snuff film per se, as in giving us a tour of this squalid other-world. And what a tour it is! The movie is lewd in suggestion only, and no more violent than many other films of its kind, so what accounts for its visceral jolt? Some of the scenes and images, the way they are filmed, have quite a impact, and the shudders I felt were real. I think that I became totally invested in the Wells character, and because he cared about the girl, I cared too. I could truly feel his pain, and not in the usual jokey sense of the phrase. We talk about graphic sex and violence, but in this movie, it's the emotions that are graphic. Wells' dive down the rabbit hole is truly awful. When he cries to his wife, ""Save me!"" it's not his physical self he's talking about. And here, too, is a movie in which the sex and violence are not there as a turn-on.Glancing at some of the critics' comments, I was really surprised. Some were truly outraged by this movie. They wrote as if they were deeply, personally offended by it. The only other time, that I know of, when this occurred, was with the movie Peeping Tom (similar subject matter), and that destroyed director Michael Powell's career. How dare he! Peeping Tom was eventually declared a masterpiece, and 8MM ought to be up on the ladder somewhere. As ugly and unpleasant as the story is, there is a place in movie heaven for films with integrity such as this."	10
 Classic Cage rocks the screen!	"Nicholas Cage always seems to have about a half dozen films released every year, with very few ever deserving a second look. But for every 5 five cheesy action flicks he does, he'll show us he can still act by doing a small engaging character drama. The nephew of famed Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, Cage delivered arguably his best performance in Leaving Las Vegas. A role that earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor in 1996.8MM was released in 1999 and has been a sort of lost gem that does deserve a second look. A talented supporting cast of Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini & Katherine Keener kicks this film up a few notches. Although the plot and subject matter might turn a few people off. 8MM refers to an old movie reel that is found in the safe of a recently deceased wealthy industrialist. It's a snuff film, where a person is killed on film after being possibly raped or tortured. The elderly widow calls on Cage's character of Tom to investigate the authenticity of the film. Tom is a suburban family man with a wife (Keener) and a baby daughter. He works as a private investigator and after viewing the disturbing film, decides to take the job. Cage usually inhabits these crazy, eccentric characters, but with Tom he grounds him with a quiet professional dignity. As he and a young adult book store employee Max California (Phoenix) dig deeper into the world of underground pornography and fetishism Tom will risk going down a dark path that some people never return. There is a great quote from Max that goes ""There are some things that you see, and you can't unsee them. Know what I mean?"" Tom and Max start investigating porn producer Eddie Poole (Gandolfini) and find that he is connected to the making of the snuff film. Tom then visits the murdered girls mother and this is where the film really gets a lot of its heart. The girl was Mary Ann Matthews; a real person and not just some statistic. She is not a forgotten runaway, but a lost girl who drifted too far away from the people who loved her. Tom wants to find the people responsible more for the girl's mother, than for the job he is being paid for. I won't get into the ending or any spoilers, but it could be looked at a few different ways. The plot and story in general needs to be taken as entertainment only. It tries to be real and authentic, but it does take place in a ""movie world"" and not the ""real world"". If any of that make sense. As I write this Nic Cage is on a streak of terrible action movies so he is due for a winner and soon.8MM was directed by Joel Schumacher, most known for a bunch of 90s action movies like Batman & Robin, A Time to Kill & The Client. A straight to DVD sequel was released in 2005 and only uses the original title to con people into renting a shitty movie."	7
 Underrated	Vastly underrated film that took a stupid amount of flak when first released.Sure we have plot holes and it's very fantasy-land in it's attitude to so called 'underground' porn, but it's still an extremely good, brutal watch. Even the slightly censored version (which is the only one around it seems) delivers the strong content.The final 3rd is especially hard hitting, the killers motive (at last) expertly handled with no psychobabble motivations on display.Nic Cage does a good job while Phoenix, Gandolfini and Stormare steal the show.	8
 Good but disturbing		6
 Disturbing, thrilling, and boring. How does that happen?		6
 Starts off strong, but collapses- **/****	"""8MM"" starts off strong but implodes at the end, unfortunately defeating the credit most of the film offers.Nicholas Cage plays Tom Welles, a Private Investigator hired by the widow of an industrial magnate (Myra Carter) and her lawyer (Anthony Heald) to examine if a ""snuff"" film found in her late husband's safe is real. The snuff is terrifying; it features a man in a leather mask stabbing a young teen (Jenny Powell), who has been reported missing. In order to discover the truth, Welles must enlist aid from Max California (Joaquin Phoenix), a porn store clerk, as they travel through the depths of human perversion and encounter villains in the ""alternative"" porn industry, including Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare), Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini), and Machine (Christopher Bauer), a twisted S&M fetish killer.Max California is by far the most interesting character in ""8MM."" Both the script and Phoenix's acting allow the audience to peer into the mind of the smut store worker, whom we sympathize with because he is good comic relief and a lonely type, working in this wasteland only to support his unsuccessful music career. Max delivers some lines expressing how the pornography industry lured him into this hell and how it is impossible to escape. In fact, Max upstages Cage's detective Welles, who is possibly the most boring person in the film. The script provides no back-story or personality for our protagonist, nor any insights into his mind. Welles's only redemption is Cage's able acting.Another great role is that of Machine, a psycho who wears a crude leather mask. Before we learn anything about Machine, he makes a fascinating maniac. Is he an evil freak with a mental illness? Is he a seemingly everyday man with a split personality? Either way, Machine is an ominous monster. Then, the screenplay goes so far as to ruin our intrigue. Rather than leave his identity to the imagination, we actually get to see Machine for who he really is. In an anti-climatic fight for life, the haunting mask is removed, accompanied with cartoonish, moronic dialogue that was intended to be witty. The revelation of Machine for who he really was is intended to be ironic and surprising, but this cliched scene was so not clever that I felt a surge of disappointment and anger at how ""8MM"" had degraded since it began. ""8MM"" mainly succeeds at presenting a disturbing, sickening tour through the corrupted minds of pornography addicts. Welles and Max actually go to a secret subterranean dungeon where illegal porn trade is dealt. Stunning and horrifying are two adjectives that describe this culture of filth. Almost every type of sex is produced and purchased here: bestiality, child porn, mutilation, fake and gory snuff, hermaphrodites, brutal S&M, etc. In one scene, several men masturbate to a female doctor, breasts exposed, stabbing a man in the buttocks with a syringe. A blow to one's mind and stomach are packaged into this film. It's overwhelming to realize that in the chasms of civilized human society, there are a few vile minds who resort to this abhorrent ""entertainment"" for pleasure.However, all of this powerful terror collapses in the last 45 minutes. All the villains come together against Welles in an over-the-top, half-witted battle with lame, corny gothic overtones. Everyone hugely overacts this scene, most noticeably Peter Stormare's Dino Velvet who has some cheesy lines to deliver (""Kill them, Machine! Kill them all!). Also, one person's appearance as an adversary is not the least bit shocking. In fact, the first time this character was introduced I said to myself, ""He's a bad guy."" This big rendezvous, no matter how poorly executed, should have ended the film. Instead, Welles runs away to his house rather than killing the unarmed bad guys. When the screenplay finally calls upon our protagonist to wrap up the movie, your interest has already faltered because the film should have ended 20 minutes ago. There's once scene when Welles has a killer tied up. The good guy has a gun, the bad guy is helpless. During this episode, the killer incessantly and obnoxiously explodes into outbursts of bloodthirsty insults about his killing of an innocent. Welles is being tortured by the taunts, but he doesn't shoot the murderer. What he does is runs to his car and moans. This is a perfect example of painfully stupid false endings ""8MM"" offers.Eventually, the phony conclusions, over-acting, naïve showdowns, predictability, and boring personas bring ""8MM"" down."	5
 I'd Really Like to Know What Movie Everyone ELSE Saw!!!!	8mm is a tense, pitch-Black thriller that we could use so much more of. The movie is intense, it's horrific, and it's easily one of the best movies I've seen this past year. Yet, when I see the score for this movie (and that HORRIFYING 19 from Metacritic), I'm really left asking: what movie did YOU see??? It's sleazy and dark, but it's supposed to be and that's what makes it so fascinating. I kinda wish we'd get more films like this today: excellent directing, fantastic performances, great cinematography, and a 2 hour runtime that doesn't waste a second of screen time. I've given this one a glowing recommendation, but I guess I maybe just saw the wrong movie. Or maybe this is the same 8mm everyone else saw and I'm just crazy or stupid or both; I wouldn't put it past myself if it's both.	9
 A powerful film that stands for justice	This film has some outstanding components. The underworld scenes set in gritty locations around Hollywood, depict places & events that could be true, even though it is just a story. In the investigators path to uncover the truth & bring those responsible for abuse & murder to justice, the fear and determination are felt with equal vigour. The use of North African Moroccan music, adds to the other worldliness feeling of this movie. There is a feeling that reality has been lost and we have entered another world, which is a part of the Hollywood allure & the music definitely helps build this feeling. This film speaks strongly that we must stand up for others and end the mistreatment and violence against the exploited and vulnerable.	9
 Cage's best movie by far.	Disturbing yet brilliant. Schumacher and Cage at their best, with Phoenix, Gandolfini and Stormare rounding it off. Highly recommended for all Cage fans.	10
 I love this movie the actors	"I don't understand why this movie in the biography of Nicholas cage is not marked as best. I love that movie. Yes, this film is sometimes too perverse. But... this movie is so realistic. This film, I think, is the best movie in biography of Nicolas cage (after the ""City of Angels""). It is very well revealed the talent of the actor. The first time I watched it in 2010 in Russia. Much later than it was published. And this film made me very very touched. I would recommend it again to see."	10
 A very good movie.... but very disturbing	The simple fact is .. over all this is a great movie.... however... It is NOT for any children... It deals with a lot of illegal sexual situations and though there may be very little nudity... It implies a lot more then anything Showgirls could have... It has been compared to Seven and it's close... not as bloody... but definitely more demented... I know it sounds like I am contradicting myself but the truth of the matter is I enjoyed it... I just believe that it's not for everyone.......	10
 great, yet really sick movie, nicolas cage is the best though	i just got home from seeing 8mm and i thought it was a really great movie, it was kinda sick though.  some scenes i had to turn my head for cuz they were really sick sex.  but, i still loved the movie and if anything, it was very very suspenseful.  nicolas cage is the best actor ever too, any other actor playing that role probably wouldn't have been half as good as nicolas cage was.	10
 Have a time to watch this movie.	Title: 8mm: Eight MillimeterPersonal Comments:  Nicolas Cage (Tom Welles)  must have play a hard  acting in this movie. Because, in this movie Nicolas Cage tracks down criminals and exposes their illegal business which was primarily on exploiting girls.This Movie is very good .. period .. and .. I like It...period.I love  H. Cage's ways of acting.Thanks to all people who made this movie. Have a time to watch this movie. - G.C.O.	
 Real Life VS Art Form, Good VS Evil	I do understand that movies are not real life, but an art form.  As the saying goes, art imitates life.  This movie may have been viewed as the ultimate Good Guy VS Bad Guy flick, but in my eyes it had many levels of understanding.  Nicolas Cage's character, Thomas Welles, is so full of emotion at times you can feel what he is feeling yourself, a task that many actors can not succeed at doing.  Even though the plot is predictable at times, this movie opened my eyes to the stereotyping that goes on in the minds of human beings.  8MM is hard to watch on a squeamish stomach, and you won't be able to take your eyes off of it.  Watch it, understand it, and you will never look at your neighbor or a stranger the same again.	7
 Curiously Refreshing...	"Like Leaving Las Vegas, another journey into the dark side of human nature that also starred Nicholas Cage, I found this movie to be curiously refreshing despite its subject matter.  Like Leaving Las Vegas, I can't say why, exactly.  It was like it cleared out some sort of mental garbage buried deep in the subconscious.  Or maybe it was that one line - ""You and I were the only ones who cared about Mary Anne.""  8/10"	8
 Disturbing	Neither my wife nor myself liked this film. I found it to be very dark and depressing. I am not oblivious to the fact that there are people like this out in the real world where we live and work, but I not not associate with this type of person. But I can avoid films like this. I strongly disliked the film, we both felt it was a waste of $3.00 the rent it.	
 8MM shows the dark side of human nature...and I like it!		9
 Suspenseful, absorbing, and powerful		10
 so underrated	I can't understand how one cannot at least appreciate this film for its honesty and its realism. It's an amazing film with terrific performances, a amazing soundtrack, and a story that isn't lost to action sequences. This film works because it never forgets that it's a social commentary and a morality play. It shows us what can happen to any normal person when they see the unspeakable. Cage is driven to murder. There is a moment in the film that makes it brillant. Cage has a gun pointed at Eddie Poole, one of the men responsible for the film. Poole taunts him, and Cage finds he can't pull the trigger. Then, he walks out to his car, and gets his cell-phone. He calls Mary Anne's mom and tells her what happens, and asks permission to kill Poole. This shows us Cage's humanity. It shows us of his normalness most of us have and it shows the effect that seeing what he has seen has created in him. It shows the emotion we would have. This is not a fake film. It's gutsy, and isn't afraid of the consequences it has. People said Cage had lost his reputation as hollywood's most risk-tasking actor. I feel this brings back that status. A Box Office king like Cage had guts to take this part. Even though it wasn't much of a success, it is Cage's most human character and a magnificent performance.	
 Wasted potential	"Disturbing images; but empty of substance. Promising gritty realism, this film delivers visually, but fails colossally to achieve any plot points. The audience is submerged into a dark detestable world, but this world ultimately becomes simply another angle on the traditional horror formula. But worse: IT NEVER TRIES TO DELVE INTO ITS VILLAINS. SPOILER- Why do these guys do those things? Cuz they're BAD. Literally no time is spent developing the bad guys; they're just scum. I'm not saying I wanted to care about them, but how about casting some light on these important (pseudo)characters? Even remotely?I expected more. ""Silence of the Lambs,"" ""Seven"": these movies bring you into the minds of monsters. That's why they're important and unforgettable.8mm had the potential to mimic true horror but wasted it by going the easy route of manipulative shock-value drama. What a disappointment."	1
 Unpleasant but under-rated		9
" ""8MM""- A very decent and enjoyable thriller despite some issues and a very messy third act. A good, solid effort from all involved in front of and behind camera."		7
 Watch the Film.	Eight Millimeter (1999): Dir: Joel Schumacher / Cast: Nicolas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix, Peter Stormare, James Gandofini, Anthony Heald: Title suggests a small object displaying the most vile evidence to the dark side of the human mind. Nicolas Cage plays a detective sent to view an eight millimeter film displaying a teenage girl butchered for sexual pleasure. When the girl is listed as missing he visits her mother and eventually embarks upon the grim reality of snuff pornography. His investigation leads to the minds that manifest them but Cage makes an unsettling decision towards the conclusion after a phone call. Director Joel Schumacher does a tense portrayal of the horrors of snuff films. It presents a stronger argument than his overrated A Time to Kill. Outstanding job by Cage who makes a tearful phone call where questions are presented and viewers are left to ponder the justification. Joaquin Phoenix works in an adult video store where his nature isn't as stereotypical as it first seems. He will assist Cage with information until fatality kicks in. Disturbing performances by Peter Stormare, Anthony Heald and James Gandolfini who represent the corrupt society at its most unlawful and sadistic. Dire facts presented when a leather mask is removed and the film's real message is revealed. This is wear appearances are deceiving when our eyes and minds have familiar expectations. Score: 9 / 10	9
 dark and creepy	Private eye Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) has a regular family life with his wife (Catherine Keener) and a baby. Daniel Longdale (Anthony Heald) is a lawyer of recently widowed Mrs. Christian. She found a shocking snuff film in her husband's possessions and she wants Welles to check its authenticity. He is hired to find the missing girl. He finds a missing report for Mary Ann Mathews which leads to California. He enlists the help of porn store clerk musician Max (Joaquin Phoenix). The trail leads to pornographer Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini) and then Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare).I really like the moody feel at the start but the L.A. stuff is borderline silly. Some of the investigation is a bit too old school. I get a sense that director Joel Schumacher is trying to hard-boiled this thriller more than necessary as a style choice. Nicolas Cage is able to keep this train on track with his intensity. Phoenix adds a good dash of color. This movie is like one of those serial killer movies. It is both disturbing and compelling.	7
 Dark side of our everyday lives		10
 A descent into depravity.	"This effectively somber and seedy drama plays somewhat like the George C. Scott film ""Hardcore"" of 20 years previous. There's no denying that it gets pretty grim and ugly, so it's not for all tastes, and will be hard for some viewers to take. Nicolas Cage does a solid job as a private investigator named Tom Welles, who's hired by the elderly Mrs. Christian (Myra Carter) to examine an item she's found in her late husbands' possession. It seems to be an honest- to-God snuff film, and Toms' job will be to find out if in fact the girl in the film really did die. His investigation takes him into a pornographic underworld populated by an abundance of stereotypically twisted monsters. They're not all bad, though: Joaquin Phoenix, in a highly engaging performance, is a new acquaintance named Max California whose dreams of fame and fortune didn't pan out and who now works in a sex shop. Max, seeming to be somewhat bored, welcomes the opportunity to assist in Welles's inquiries. Among the assorted lowlifes are slimy film director Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare, who's a real scene stealer), ""Machine"" (Chris Bauer), the masked star of Velvets' epics, and volatile thug Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini). This film is not exactly unpredictable, as it leads to a fair bit of foreseeable developments, and as it plays out falls into the ""talking villain"" trap more than once. Still, this is a reasonably compelling, fascinating walk on the dark side of life, at least in the early going, before the story telling starts becoming more conventional. A good supporting cast really helps. Anthony Heald, no stranger to slime ball roles himself, is an attorney, Catherine Keener, rather wasted, plays the thankless role of the concerned wife, and Carter is fine as the guilt ridden old lady. The best scenes revolve around the haunted mother of the murder victim, extremely well played by Amy Morton, and the climactic confrontation with Machine is also superb in the way it dispenses with some clichés and negates any sort of preconceived notions we might have had about the character. Jenny Powell, who plays the victim, is a stripper in real life and some actual porn actresses pop up in bits. The look of the film is appropriately gloomy, with lots of night scenes and the aforementioned climax which conveniently takes place in the rain. Overall, not bad; the film has some humour but mostly plays it straight until its inevitable conclusion. Followed by a direct to DVD sequel. Seven out of 10."	7
 Hard to believe this came from the director of Batman and Robin.		9
 Like Hardcore but with Suspense and Revenge on the Side. Good Film.	I put off watching this movie for 12 years thinking that it was just a remake of Hardcore from the 70's with George C. Scott and Peter Doyle and the private eye. Hardcore was one of my favorite movies as a kid. Jism Jim and George C. had some great lines in the movie and it was seedy and scummy enough to inspire this 13 year old's imagination.Fast forward 25 years to last night, my old lady wanted to watch a thriller on the Roku and this one popped up so I caved in and watched it. You know what? This is how a remake should be done. The story is altered enough to make it fresh and new elements are added to boost the juice.The original Hardcore had the guy's runaway daughter get into drugs and porn and associating with a snuff film producer. George C. Scott takes over from the lame private eye and teams up with a peep show girl to traverse the sex trade underground in search of Rattan, the snuffer, and his daughter. Once he finds her, she is alive and it is over.In 8mm, Cage is the private dick trying to figure out if the girl on film is really dead and he teams up with a loser who works at an adult book store to traverse the seedy underground of the sex business. Of course the chick really is dead, but Cage finds the film makers and gets revenge for the snuffed teen. Also there is a twist with his client's lawyer being in on it and double crossing Cage. So this movie is similar to Hardcore but darker and with revenge, action and a lame twist thrown in.I've got to say that Schumacher must've found the scumiest locations in each city to shoot because man he made New York, LA, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh look like the most depressing places on the planet. Great acting by Gandolfini as the seedy and greedy producer and the guy who played Dino Velvet, ever so creepy and deranged.If you've been putting this off because you're a fan of Hardcore and think that this is just a straight remake, give it a look see. It is different enough from the original to be interesting and has some more elements to it.As far as the twist. It was lame and almost predictable. A better twist would have been to mimic the old movie and have the girl alive but all strung out and in love Dino and the Machine then having her kill Cage so that her mother never finds out where she is. Now that is a much better twist and in the spirit of the original film. But overall the movie was dark, depressing and good. Give it a chance. AnchovyD	7
 You dance with the devil, the devil don't change. The devil changes you.	I saw this film with very low expectations. I was expecting it to be some silly thriller about some private investigator trying to find out the truth abut a six year old crime. But after I saw it, I was really impressed by it. I think this is one the most under-rated films around to date. After I saw 8MM, i decided to check the rating for it on IMDb. I was surprised by the rating that it had. I was expected it to be a 7. But it is in the low 6 range. 8MM is a movie that is in not for the faint of heart. This movie has some very disturbing scenes in it. But I thought it could have been a little better if some of the sexuality/nudity was cut out. Nicolas Cage did a really good job playing the lead character. It also has great performances by Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini and Peter Stormare. This is one of Joel Schumachers better films.	10
 Chilling and effective. 8/10		8
 A great role for Cage, and a pretty good movie overall.	"A private investigator is called in by a wealthy widow to determine the authenticity of a ""snuff"" film found in the personal safe of her late husband. It's an interesting plot that sends the investigator (Nicholas Cage) combing through the seedy underworld of illegal pornography in order to find the maker of the film. I know, it sounds like a bad b-movie plot that is filled with gratuitous skin shots of would-be actresses, but it isn't. The film is filled with excellent acting. In particular I liked Joaquin Phoenix as the smart and savvy porn store clerk who dreams of being a rock star but got stuck working at a XXX bookstore. Peter Stormare is also excellent as Dino Velvet, a twisted porn producer/director who is as creepy as they come. 8mm is a well made and entertaining move."	7
 A fantastic movie	"Its so rare I see a good original script get the kind of funding and attention this movie got. Someone had their thinking cap on when they decided to produce this. The cinematography really seals the deal for me on this movie. The script is genius, the acting is great, but the casting stole the show on this film. I have never been so pleasantly surprised with the casting as I was with this movie. Juaquin Phoenix is a master of his craft. He could play Tina Turner and I'd believe it. Is there any limit to his range? Unlike ""The Village"" where Sigourney Weaver couldn't keep up with him in scenes, Nick Cage does a great job. This is a true thriller. It doesn't rely on silly CG stuff or fictional monsters, it is about something much scarier. Real monsters. The ones living among us every day. Yes it delves into the world of adult film, but not in a gratuitous way at all. In fact there is very little in the way of nudity or adult material. Just enough to show the viewer what private detective Tom Wells is going through. If you're a thriller fan, this is a must see movie. Watch it, you'll thank me after."	9
 Got to be one of the best	I have watched 8MM at least a dozen time since i bought the DVD last week,i got to admit that it is one of the best snuff film based movie i've ever seen.(though mute witness movie too come close but it is sort comic thriller) The characters in the 8MM were more of 3 dimensional,everyone affects the viewer in some way(especially the snuff victim's mother and the Joaquin phoenix) One could feel subtle tension throughout the movie,its impossible to miss great acting by cage. Background score is mild and pleasant whereas the screenplay is tight and entertaining,not to forget the good camera work. Overall 8MM is an out and out entertaining edge of the seat thriller with some melodrama Don't miss this movie at least watch it once ,im very sure you wont be disappointed	10
 Nicolas Cage was Fantastic	Once the film started, I knew I was going to enjoy every minute of this film. Nicolas Cage gets himself deeply involved with a very rich mysterious client who lives in a huge mansion and has a horrible film which her recently deceased husband had hidden. Cage meets up with some very bad degenerates who love Sex more than anything else and make their living trying their very best to horrify their sick customers. There are excellent film locations in California, Long Island, N.Y. and many other places where Cage has to try and track down certain characters in order to solve this mystery. Meanwhile, Cage has a wife and baby who begin to wonder why their husband and father is kept away for such long periods of time. This is definitely a great film to enjoy from beginning to end.	10
 Extremely disturbing, and meant to be	I knew this movie wouldn't get the rating it deserved because of how awful and disturbed it leaves the viewer. But then you realize that it is real. None of the sex or violence is gratuitous. The film displays the deepest levels of perversion found in the human heart, and pits against that perversion the only kind of hero that could face it down: flawed, pained, tough, and at his core, genuinely good and caring. No punches are pulled. For the sex addicts, the film has sympathy, but no mercy. They are shown as losing the battle with their own souls, but at least fighting it. That's how addicts are, and as in real life, nothing saves them in the end. Nick Cage is correctly cast as possibly the only man in Hollywood capable of the role. Phoenix has you hoping from the start that Max can be saved, even though you pretty much know better all along. It's an amazing film.	10
 Not very good, but OK for this kind of a movie, I guess		6
 A shadow of the great movie that it isn't.		
 good, but very unpleasant	Well acted and directed, but this movie is filled with severely unpleasant and disgusting material, which took away any chance of me actually 'enjoying' the film. It has a very convincing atmosphere. Nicholas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix are both very good. But the ending didn't ring true for me. Joel Schumacher is a good director, I haven't seen his 'Tigerland' as of yet, but I think most of his finished products are beneath what he is capable of.	7
 Darkest film ever made	Wow....this has to be one of the most darkest and disgusting films ever. It was well made and well written but what's with Cage's acting during the scene where he was watching the snuff film???Schumacher is a good director!	
 Sick........Just sick	"Ok, don't get me wrong, Nicholas Cage is one of my all time favorite actors. Unfortunately, he is attracted to dark, seedy movies (8mm, Bringing out the Dead, etc.).  ""8mm"" has got to be one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen.  Now, I admit, movies like ""Starship Troopers"" had more BLOOD that this, but there's a crucial difference: In Starship Troopers, the blood was gross, but not unsettling or disturbing.  In 8mm, however, the very knowledge that innocent people were being killed for the sake of porn was downright disgusting.  I have no idea how this film got an R rating, while films like American Pie originally got NC-17.  If you have a tough stomach, and are interested in snuff films, you might want to consider this."	
 It is good work by Schumacher,it is a movie of serious intent. There's no faulting Cage's committed, intense performance	8mm is neither the sick exploitation film nor the risible misfire the critics had labelled it -- it is a movie of serious intent.Director Joel Schumacher steadily turns on the tension.8mm Powerfully played and conscientiously filmed. It's a complex achievement, exciting, sad and profound at the same time. This is not a movie for the squeamish, by any means. But for those who like their thrillers dark and their heroes a bit more complicated and flawed than the average shoot-without-a-blink type so prevalent in today's movies, 8MM fills the bill.Intense but very engaging.One of the most daring and attentive films.It is a real film. Not a slick exploitation exercise.Strangely compelling, the film works best as an old-fashioned private eye movie, with Welles carrying out mundane investigative work as he becomes increasingly obsessed with finding answers and uncovering the truth.Cage is the film's greatest asset! It was a return to form for director Joel Schumacher in 1999.	10
 another Hollywood crap-fest	This film is quite a let down.  Its depiction of the S&M scene is nothing other than cliche.  It appears that the script may have had some potential. However, the film makers chose the easy way out and kept everything on the predictable level.  The characters are all flat flavorless bores. Especially Cage's.  It's a prime example of one dimensionality.  The film takes no risks, although the marketing will have you thinking the movie delves deep into the dark side of the human psyche.  In reality, it's nothing more than a waste of 2 1/2 hours.The best part for me was during the big climactic scene as Cage is creeping in the big bad evil guy's house, the projector died and the lights came on. Best laugh in the whole movie...	1
 A total waste of time		1
 Insultingly bad	Unless you're looking for a cinematic equivalent of a disposable airport paperback then please avoid this cheap cliché ridden excuse for a film. Think of all the usual archetypes you'd expect to find in a straight to video American thriller and you have the ingredients for 8mm. A dead girl, a grief-stricken lonely mother, a stressed out workaholic PI who's neglecting his worrying wife, some bad men with facial hair who swear a lot and make seedy porn films (they don't have houses in the country, wives and babies like our licensed firearm carrying hero). You can guess the rest.If you're looking for any kind of intelligent film-making, you will be insulted by Schumacher's offering here.	1
" ""A deep look of a underground filming wild world"""		8
 A dark journey in the recesses of some unpure and evil minds, make engrossing viewing, ala Schumacher		7
 Grim but gripping	8MM is a grim but gripping thriller where private detective Nicholas Cage is engaged to investigate whether a snuff movie is genuine or not, and finds himself reluctantly embroiled in the world of those who make such things.The film successfully raises moral issues, not least concerning Cage's actions towards the end of the movie - has he become like those he seeks to hold to account? - but I think the issues are sufficiently clear, in terms of right and wrong, that the film is not compromised in this area.However, I am a little concerned that in some respects the film may derive part of its appeal by accessing the prurient interest of the audience concerning the content of the very snuff movies it rightly portrays as appalling. However, it is difficult to see how you could make a film on this subject otherwise.The film is well made and well performed, but this is strong meat and should not be approached as if it was a straightforward run-of-the-mill crime thriller.	8
 Pretty good except for one weak point...		7
 A Dark, mysterious and effective detective story.		7
 Gripping film experience	"I totally went to watch this movie unknowing the content and I was shocked but at the same time gripped by the intense plot. This is not a film to watch rather it is a film to experience. No beauty or romance just a story that cuts to the gut of porn film dealers and the brutality that occurs. However the violence is purely used to strengthen the plot which I think was importation in this film to give it validity. The bad guys are really the bad guys in this! Then diametric to the ""darkside"" was Nicholas trying to bring justice but finds that just being the hero isn't enough. He has to struggle as to what is right and wrong with dealing with some of the worst scum. Joaquin Phoenix is good to have in the film. He brings a medium to both of the opposing sides. Also, he really makes you feel for his death and only further strengthens the absolute cruelty of the porn producers. Finally, the ending is the best part of the film. It really builds it up to a climax. So it's a film that asks questions and explores which engages the mind of the ""experience-er""."	7
 Disturbing, but amazing	"I have seen 8 MM three times now, and each time I watch it, I make it a point to focus on a different character. The most recent time I watched the film, I made it a point to focus on ""Machete"", even though his screen time is brief. I don't know what changes were made to Andrew Kevin Walker's script, but if Machete's lines are the same, Walker is brilliant. (Spoilers here!!!) The fact that he does what he does because he likes it made the entire movie worthwhile. I hate when the killer in a film became the person he/she is because of some past trauma or psychological condition. It can work, but it has been so over done. Here we are presented with a man who kills for the sheer thrill of it. He knows he can get away with it, he knows he is protected, and most of all, he gets paid to do it. He looks nothing like we expect, he lives in a normal, suburban neighborhood (the only cliché was the fact that it was next to a graveyard), and he lives with his mother/grandmother.That said, the film itself is also very well done. Schumacher almost redeems himself from destroying the Batman franchise in the 90's. The characters are well-rounded, though I would have liked to see a little more of Catherine Keener's character, but she did well with the small part she had. Nicholas cage does an excellent job as the private investigator who gets in too deep, and Joaquin Phoenix was perfect as Max California (""I'd hate to see you in a situation where you needed a battery operated vagina and didn't have one""). However, I think it can be safely said that the best role in 8 MM was Peter Stormare. His portrayal of Dino Velvet is downright scary. He's depraved, he's sick, he's a pervert of unimaginable proportions, and he's an ""artist"". He shows no concern for the lives of others and is obviously interested only in making twisted films for good money.All in all, I gave this film an 8 out of 10. Some may consider that a bit high, but I think when you put all the elements of this film together, it adds up pretty well. Yes it is shocking, yes it is dark (in fact, it's one of the darkest films I've seen in a while), but it's a well written, well directed and well acted work. Definitely worth seeing at least once."	8
 If you have children, this is a violently frightening movie	"From the moment I happened to flip across this movie, about 10 minutes into the story, I was mesmerized. This movie will take you into the most vile underbelly of our deceitfully, pretending to be wholesome, society. Nicholas Cage nails his character from the moment he steps onto the screen. As he travels along the path his journey takes him you see his gradual realization of just how depraved and sick people in our society can behave and the lengths they will go to to feed that depravity. He has an outward nonchalantness about him, like he ""has seen it all"" sort of attitude because of his chosen line of work. Very quickly he begins to realize that what he has seen is nothing compared to what he is beginning to see. This movie is well-written, well-directed, well-acted and well-thought out. It draws you in and never lets go until the very end and at the end you wonder if his character or you, for that matter, will ever view things quite the same ever again. Unfortunately, what is portrayed in this movie, snuff-films,really do exist and there is no telling how many missing teenagers end up like this child in this movie, that is why I say if you have children be afraid, be very afraid. The entire time I was watching this story unfold I was thinking about my 15 year old and at times it made me feel physically ill. This movie is definitely not for the faint of heart or the squeamish. It is gritty, in-your-face realism and the tones and colors in this film make you feel it's tenor the entire time.If you like taut, psychological thrillers then this movie is for you. And as another review stated, sometimes you don't have to actually see, in its entirety, what is happening your own imagination can, unfortunately, fill in the blanks on it's own. The only reason I gave it a 9 and not a 10 is one scene in the movie is never really fully explored or explained (the suicide) you are just kind of left to draw your own conclusions, which, maybe that was the whole point of that particular part, but, alas I shall never really know the truth. Just be ready to see something you never really wanted to see or know about in the first place. Martha-Alabama BTW: Afterthought--I wanted to see this movie when it first came out and then I forgot about it and then found it flipping channels on satellite. That explains my review of a movie that is several years old but just now reviewed by me :)"	9
 Oh my lord.... Wackeen has blue hair!	No don't worry this film isn't entirely about Joaquin having blue hair, but it does it for the girls, as does his role as a naughty undergroundy porno guy type, but also a disturbing thriller uncovering a quiet secret world of the 'snuff'. Fairly perverted and at times sick, this will satisfy those with unusual film appitites and Schu' doesn't let you down in the directorial department delivering some beautiful filmaking. Fans of Cage's previous work will find he is on full form as the 'good guy' but will pity his poor wife and baby, anybody who wants to see the bad side of Joaquin will sink their teeth in deep. Be warned- this ain't no run of the mill Cage thriller, get ready for something interesting...	8
 Slimy yet Satisfying, Gross but Brilliant	This movie, though at times sickening and very hard to watch, is amazing. We all know about pornography and twisted people in leather and whips, but most of us don't delve deep into thinking about the lives of these people. This movie does and it is disgusting. I didn't really realize how big the underground porno industry is, though the film is fictional, there is no doubt in your mind, that somewhere, this is really happening...girls wanting to get famous, sickos looking for new and different ways to fulfill their darkest fantasies. And the character Tom Welles is easy to support and cheer for, because what he feels when he looks upon this industry, is exactly what you will feel. Nicolas Cage is brilliant, and captivating and Joaquin Phoenix is also delightful to watch. His character Max California is the only lovable character in the film and Phoenix plays him well enough to make you fall in love for his joyous character, so that in his last moments you will feel for him and be shocked. He is also darn hot too, in his little Gothic way. Unfortunately though in this film, justice is served. And as an audience you know that in the real world, that just isn't the case. Though it is satisfying to see the bad guys get what they deserve, you know that it would be far more believable if Cage's character Tom Welles had been killed by the disgusting Machine character. I especially found Cage's performance at the end of movie to be completely truthful and I nearly cried for Welle's poor tormented soul. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat, and though it is restricted to 18+ I recommend younger teens (15/16/17) to see it, so they don't take the easy way to fame. Death.	7
 Nicholas Cage takes a trip into the dark side of humanity.	As subject matters go, this one (snuff films) is pretty gruesome. Are there really people who get a kick out of that sort of thing? Anyway, the film itself is both disturbing and touching, especially the scenes involving Cage and his baby daughter. The villains are evil, exploiting young women and coming across as creepy pond scum. Cage's character is a street-wise private eye who gets a strange case, looking for a porn actress who appeared on one of the snuff movies mentioned earlier. Was she really murdered, or is it a hoax? We work out the answer soon enough, or rather Nicholas does. I think this is his best film, and I recommend it.	8
" ""I'd hate for you to be caught in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery operated vagina & you just don't have one."" Reasonable thriller."	8MM starts with private detective Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) receiving a phone call from an attorney named Daniel Longdale (Anthony Heald) who represents Mrs. Christian (Myra Carter) whose rich husband has recently died. Welles meets Mrs. Christian who says that she has discovered a reel of film in her late husbands safe that appears to be snuff & seemingly show's a young girl being brutally abused & murdered, she asks Welles if he will investigate the film & try to put her mind at rest that it's fake. Welles accepts, with a little detective work he learns that the girls name is Mary Ann Mathews (Jenny Powell) & that she was reported missing several years ago. After speaking with her mum Janet (Amy Morton) the case takes him to California where he meets porn shop clerk Max California (Joaquin Phoenix) whom he enlists to help guide him through the underground world of S/M & hard porn to find the men responsible for the supposed snuff film... This American German co-production was co-produced & directed by Joel Schumacher & is a reasonably entertaining thriller with a sleazy undertone. The script by Andrew Kevin Walker (who apparently left the film after a disagreement with Schumacher who along with Nicholas Kazan reworked the script) moves along at a decent enough pace although I was starting to get a little bored by the end & I think at 2 hours it's too long & drawn out. The story is simple with basic mystery elements that don't particularly grip or engage, the whole thing is somewhat predictable & it paints the entire S/M & porn community as gun carrying sadistic freaks which clearly they are not. Virtually all the character's in 8MM that Welles runs into are scum who peddle sick porn for their own gain & care little for anyone else, nothing like having a balanced point of view... I also found the climax where Welles phoned Mary's mum for justification & permission to take revenge on the people reasonable for her daughter's death really silly & just didn't work for me. Having said that it still provides decent entertainment & is certainly watchable if you want something a little darker than usual. The actual porn & violence content is rather low, there is some nudity & gore but things are generally kept to a minimum, there is however plenty of very strong language. With a supposed budget of about $40,000,000 8MM doesn't do anything to justify that sort of money, the film looks slick, it has a gritty washed-out look & is well made for sure but nothing really stands out. The acting is OK especially the likable Phoenix although Cage isn't that good & is undistinguished, bland & forgettable as Welles as he makes the transition from a normal everyday life to one filled with porn & darkness. I quite liked 8MM, it's a pretty good thriller but ultimately the misinformed moral stance on S/M & porn in general hurts it & the story itself could have been a little stronger as it contains one of the most unsurprising twists I've ever seen & little justification is given for anything that happens. Worth a watch but by no means a masterpiece, try to catch it on TV for free.	6
 The dark side of things...	This Hollywood flick explores the underground world of snuff films, with entertaining, albeit disturbing, results. The film, to its credit, doesn't shy away from the subject matter, giving it a suitably dark and depressing tone. I also quite like the setup; a wealthy old man with a skeleton in his closet, only to be revealed after he dies. All the actors fit nicely into their characters too, with Nicolas Cage giving one of his better performances in a difficult role. Of course, as a Hollywood production, it does have some requisite glitz but its still a solid, effective film. The commentary with director Joel Schumacher is decent and informative, as he rarely lets up.	7
 brutally violent but decent	Many reviewers have deemed this film offensive because of the quantity of violence that proves futile and disturbing; besides, it would also lack suspense and mystery; I don't like either some impressive sequences but, all in all, I find it entertaining and conscientiously filmed, with a thorough attention to details as well. Joel Schumacher jumps his way into the hidden worlds of voyeurism and pornography, putting on the screen the worst perversions of human beings. I figure Nicholas Cage acted over the average, showing how a naive and innocent man, after being through shootings, knifings and beatings of any sort, can finally turn into a terribly violent man.	7

 Underrated, a wonderful piece. But only for those who can handle it.

 Underrated	The unexpectedly low rating of 8MM I think can only be attributed to the choice of the movie's main theme - snuff & porno. Although the scenario tries to compensate the gritty elements by over-injecting 'the family values', and (unconvincingly) sugaring the main character in his home sweet home, many believe the movie is revolting due to the very fact that it's about the snuff. On the other hand, others expect the movie to overshadow porno flicks they accustomed to, and blame the director because it hasn't ( big surprise huh ). I think that the unbiased appreciation of 8MM can only come from these who don't fall in either group, which is surprisingly small, so here I'll try to comment from this point of view.*MINOR SPOILERS*. Cage's hero, PI Tom Welles, investigates origins of a snuff movie, but the path leads too deep, and at the end his family is in danger. No surprise that the film ends with the bad guys dead and the family saved. The real interest is to watch the Welles' character, its transformations along the path, especially his resistance to kill Eddie, who actually didn't kill himself. The scene where Welles doesn't know what to do with Eddie, and calls to Mrs.Mattews to get a licence to kill, and receives none, I think is a turning point for him. I personally doubt that this would be a first kill for a PI with such a reputation, but imagining it is, Cage acted this transition from an average guy into a resolute killer very, very convincing.I think the movie is worth watching, but certain tolerance is required, both for hard 'snuff' and soft 'family' parts. ***/****	8
 Good movie, disturbing and truly twisted	This movie is one of those movies that people either really like or really hate. I for one happen to be in love with dark,twisted movies,and this one is no exception. I'm not going to waste my time explaining the plot, there are many other comments already on here that can do that,but I'll state why I like this movie. I've always liked Andrew Kevin Walker, but Joel Schumacher...never really liked what he's done, but this has to be his best. The imagery in the film is very depicting of filth and can stick to your head. The music in some scenes is brutal and disgusting, and the acting is superb. I really like Cage and Gandolfini together. Gandolfini brings his brutal character physique and aggressive personality alive, and puts together the perfect porno advertiser or whatever. The story had a few flaws, but I'm glad it got made. Actually, I wasn't surprised one bit why it had such a low rating, it was filthy. Most people don't want to see this, as it shows the pure weaknesses of our society, primarily American. I'm sure if this took place in Asia, it wouldn't be as bad. Give it a shot, and be fair, but still, proceed with caution.	
 Great Movie, but too Hardcore for Cage fans	I saw this movie on video after I borrowed it from a friend. Having seen Cage hits, Gone in 60 Seconds, Face/Off, and Snake Eyes, I was expecting another great Cage movie, of which I was not disappointed. And with a class act like James Gandolfini(The Soprano's), one couldn't help but be pleased. The story: Tom Welles(Cage) is hired by an old lady to investigate a movie she found after her husbands death, that has the brutal murder of a young girl in an S+M video. So Welles goes looking and gets caught up in the chase. When he does find the murderer, he confronts him and kills him. The story is all whacked, but it is suspenseful, and interesting at times. Using skills like that in Snake Eyes, Cage gives a brilliant performance, but any hope of the movie being worth watching (to most people anyway) is clouded by the S+M flavor which in my opinion istaken a little too far. If this does not bother you, and you are looking for good acting and decent action, this is for you. 7/10.	
 Very good thriller!		9
 Gripping	Relative to what has been said before, I watched this film and wondered why Joel Schumacher hadn't devoted this kind of dark intensity to Batman & Robin.  I didn't see all the graphic stuff since this was what the USA network made of it, and I think the cut out parts gave an edge from uncertainty as to why Tom was cringing from what he was watching.  This movie kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.	8
 not a bad idea but the film is overdone	Lurid thriller about the dark and disturbing underworld of hardcore pornography. Nicolas Cage stars as a private investigator who gets recruited by a wealthy widow to investigate the authenticity of her late husband's 'snuff film,' in which a young girl appears to be murdered. Against his better judgment, he takes the case and the investigation draws him into a disturbing netherworld of sadism and sexuality that threaten to break his sanity. Unpleasant, even borderline unbearable at times, like you'd expect considering the film's graphic subject matter, though well-crafted and performed by a talented cast, but it's let down by unconvincing characters and an unbelievable climax. **½	
 Dark Film	This is the dark side of human nature exploring sexual perversion to its horrifying conclusions in this case.Reasonable acting performances add to a chilling subject which, if I have one criticism only about this movie, is rather rammed down the viewers throat incessantly throughout the picture.It only gets a 6/10 because of occasional inconsistent direction perhaps designed to throw the viewer but ends up just being annoying in the final analysis. However if you can stomach it this is worth one viewing.	6
 A spooky look into snuff	8MM is the type of film you have nightmares about, but well made ones at that.  Joel Schumacher brings Andrew Kevin Walker's Eight-Millemeter to the screen with superb acting (mainly by Nicolas Cage, but the supporting cast is also very good), a terrifying story with more twists than a pretzel factory, and many other great things.  Of course not for all tastes, but for fans of mystery films, or even Cage/Schumacher fans, this film is for you. True, snuff is no matter to bring to the screen, but Schumacher puts it on the screen so well you forget about it's bad effect (except on the person Cage is trying to find in the movie).  Well done suspense thriller, one of Schumacher's best.	7
 Worth a Look	"This was a bit disappointing.  I agree that Cage's acting ability was totally wasted in the first half of the film, he appeared to be sleep-acting. The build up was far too slow and boring.  Not enough of the underworld was reveiled visually during this ""slow beginning"" to give the viewer the outrage necessary to bring the films powerful ending to the maximum potential effect.  The story was good, the players were good, but the weak direction managed to miss the mark (for me)."	7
 Somewhat boring, dark, detective drama. Wait for video!		7
 good thriller movie	A good 90's thriller movie , all actors especially Nicolas made this movie great . recommended to Nicolas fans .	7
 Nicolas Cage shows versatility	This underrated work perhaps suffers from identication with the sexploitation it centres on, and in fact if you ask a big actor to get involved with this kind of seedy mix he might well have second thoughts about reputation. But Nic comes out clean in my book here, and indeed also the creative team. It has a gritty shadowy Noir feel thanks to the direction which feels arty, and in no way did I feel exploited as a viewer. There are some flaws but the ambition and adventure of the project eclipses these. There's some soul-searching, but it's also got the actioner elements and some pace, but above all its got Cage acting at full tilt (at least for him and his restrained persona) and it all worked out pretty fun in the end (as well as a bit bloody creepy).	9
 Gripping	Second time I have watched this film and I find it gripping and disturbing! Cage is excellent in the lead playing an investigator employed to find out if a supposed snuff film is real or a well acted hoax.	8
 Grossly underrated	I cannot believe imbd has given this 6.5 ,emotional,,disturbing and sad ,I highly recommend it .	8
 Into the perverse underworld of smut, S&M and snuff films		7
 Gritty and disturbing	A dark and gritty view of the world of underground distributed videos. This film has received mostly negative reviewed from critics citing is as too dark, violence and excessive but overall the film is quite intense and gripping, in a good way. 8MM is quite engaging from the beginning, although predictable the story it tells keeps guessing at every turn.	7
 Life-Changing Movie Experience on 35mm Film		7
 Fun Ride!	This is great filmmaking right here. I would not say this is Academy Award winning stuff, but it has a story that never lets you go, and is intriguing and somewhat thought provoking. This movie had me from start to finish, and very very seldom let me go. That is how I know a good movie from a bad one, it makes you forget about everything else and absorbs you.8 Stars!!! Though it probably is a 7 at best, I liked it though!	8
 8MM Kicks a**!	I was lucky enough to score tickets to a preview screening of 8MM, and let me tell you, this is one cool movie, although it is certainly not one for those who get easily disturbed. Nicolas Cage turns in a great performance as the seedy private dick, and as always is absolutely riveting to watch. The support cast is also very good. 8MM is filled with many suspenseful moments, and is genuinely very frightening. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a smart, non-mainstream mystery-thriller. 9 out of 10.	
 A disturbing flick but good nonetheless	I just got back from seeing 8mm on opening night (my birthday as well) with some friends and we had mixed reviews on it. They said it wasn't something they'd like to think about anymore because of its disturbing nature. I also thought it was disturbing but it was a fine film. It delved deep into the seedy underworld of porn but not so deep as to be overly perverse. When Cage views the box marked XXX-Way TOO Far, and the man tells him they are rape films, I thought that that was the cream of the crap...but snuff is even worse. What my friends and I took with us after this movie was that seedy porn dealers are the trash of this earth and it's very, very disturbing to know that somewhere out there, they are dealing in and making snuff films...sometimes with kids like the girl in the film.	6
 Dark; not for the faint-of-heart	Ultimately, at its core, 8mm follows the standard nice-cop-faces-evil plot. It's very well done, probably worth a 7 or 8 out of ten (I gave it an 8 'cause it's the sort of role I like to see Nic Cage in, as opposed to mindless crap like Con Air).8mm does a nice job with the way the events affect the protagonist; there's a very tangible, and not exactly pleasant, change in him over the course of the film.  Which makes for a better film than if it were just the usual serious guy beating down evil.Good movie overall.  Not a good first-date film though.	7
 An excellent view of the dark side of humanity.	"Nicolas Cage, as I expected, gave a great performance and Joel Schumaker proved to me that he can indeed still make decent films. The film was indeed reminiscent of ""Seven"". It shows the sick and twisted side of humanity and just how far a man can fall from grace. The world is ruled by money and connections and those who have them are often above the law. It wasn't as predictable as ""Seven"", though it started out slower. However, when the film got good... man, did it get good."	9
 Not as disturbing as Seven, but definitely disturbing	I truly liked this movie, it definitely had the same feel as Seven, but it showed us a completely different dark world.  All in all this was a well written and well directed film.	8
 Wow. Powerful.	"I went into this with high hopes, and I wasn't disappointed.  ""8MM"" proved to my viewing companion that I was right:  Joel Schumacher *is* an excellent director, provided he has a strong enough script to work with, and Walker reproves his...well, genius may a bit too strong of a word, but he's very, very, very good at what he does.  (We'll excuse ""Brainscan"".)  It's uniformly well-acted and terrificly shot, and one final note:  I can't remember the name of the guy who did the score, but keep an eye on him. This one was Oscar-worthy."	9
 Won't Play Long at a Theatre Near Me.	"Gritty and uncompromising look at the grim underbelly of this particular beast, snuff and sado porn. Cage again demonstrates his ability to honestly tackle unpopular and unpleasant subject matter, as he did with suicidal alcoholism in ""Leaving Las Vegas.""In a movie market where ""Rug Rats"" and ""Water Boy"" played for months, there were three people in the audience when I attended a showing of ""8 mm"" this Friday evening of its opening week."	7
 Could have been better		7
 Incredible. No way to prepare yourself for this film.	This is without a doubt one of the best films of the new year. Joel Schumacher blew me away with this film. He returns to fine form after destroying the Batman franchise. Nicolas Cage is in fine form once again. Definitely a must see!	9
 A dark thriller that shows humans at their most brutal form	"When a small time private eye (Cage) takes a big case, it propels him into the porn underworld, in search of the origins of a ""snuff"" film.  8MM excelently portrays a not so unusual marriage on the rocks, between Cage and Keener which is very convincing.  Then it moves into a dark and dingy world of very disturbed people, and the effects it has on Cage.A wonderful look at what can drive a person over the edge.  A must see film, but don't expect the incredible ride to be pleasant."	8
 Something missing...	I saw the movie last night, and I thought it was a alright movie, but something just seemed to missing.  Yeah, like the other people said, it seemed to be lacking script-wise.  It's not the best movie in the world, but considering everything out there now, if you aren't in the mood for some teenaged audience-directed fluff, it's a contender. One thing I liked alot though was Joaquin Phoenix.  He seems to steal the stage from Nick, but then again, you have to blame the script.	6
 Action/Thriller with a conscience.	It is no surprise that this movie as the same atmospheric feel as Se7en considering that both films share the same writer.  A few scenes are almost repeated.  However, the movie goes a little further in developing the effects of the events on Nicholas Cage's character and in an effective and convincing way.Few and far between is the action/thriller that possess any consequence of the events of the film after the credits roll.  8mm pulls no punches and gives no simple easy answers to the questions it asks and that is a refreshing change from Hollywood.Not for the queasy, but it is the type of film that makes you want to cover your eyes but peak through your fingers.  Considering the disturbing subject matter, that is the best kind of film.	7
 Disturbing, but excellent nevertheless	Some have criticized 8mm for its dark nature, perverse subject matter, and depraved situations it depicts.  Though I can understand why some would be turned off by the twisted villains, I must state that the film itself, if viewed objectively, was a fine picture.  Even if someone did not care for the subject matter or was disturbed by the images shown, that person should not discount the wonderful acting, gripping plot, and realistic nature of the film.  I particularly enjoyed the fact that this was no fantasy-land film; just as he was warned, Cage's character was changed by what he saw/experienced.  Personally, I enjoyed the film and, though some may have different tastes, I would ask that everyone who reviews this film at least give credit where credit is due.	8
 A Movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.	This movie is one of those movies that you will remember for days if not weeks. Walker's style of using graphic scenes is essential to the movie, this style is probably to freak people out, and I think it works. Just like Se7en this movie takes some unexpected turns, and the story is an original one. This is a good movie. Cage does a good job, and Phoenix too. I didn't expect it to be as good as Se7en, but it came really close. In summary, 8MM is cool.	7
 It's not what it's about that's disturbing	"Caution: May contain spoilersIt's not the plot or premise that's disturbing, it's the actors and their actions.  Cage goes so over the top with his character that he's going down the other side.  He's a PI that becomes so personally involved with his missing persons case that he loses all objectivity, this might have been more realistic if it didn't happen shortly after taking the case.  The character of his wife is so poorly written.""She didn't realize he'd be away from home as a PI!?""  His wife is so annoying I was hoping the film wouldn't get back to her. The best performance was given by Jaoquin Phoenix, he is believable and the only character that I cared about.  He helps Cages PI find the truth and even though he knows more about the world their about to become intimate with he doesn't let it cloud his judgement, shame the PI doesn't have the same focus. It's unbelievable that a PI as smart as Cages character, it is an impressive job he does finding the girl in the film, would do in the film makers in the end and leave such a trail of these killings to himself- the phone call to the girls mother. This is one for the free rental after 5 rentals."	
 Disturbing and controversial	8MM is a very disturbing movie, due to its controversial theme: snuff. It shows us how sick snuff really is, and you are guaranteed to be engaged by this film. Nicolas Cage plays Thom Welles, a private-detective, who has been hired by the widow of a recently deceased leader of a steel company. The widow has found a piece of 8MM film in her husbands private belongings. It shows the murder of a young woman, and the widow wants Welles to find out if the movie is a fake or not. Welles is about to enter a sick and twisted world of pornographers, as he search for the guys who made the film, and the girl on it(if she`s alive, that is). Not a classic, not very good, but worth a shot if you want a thriller which theme is snuff.  It tells us that people who see/make snuff-films are indeed extremely sick people, but many of them look just like normal persons. 6,5/10	
 Controversial Thriller		
 murder mystery with boxing	Great one time view. I loved it the first time through, interesting twists and turns.  A mixture of action, and intelligent problem solving.  Good performances, but once you've seen it once you've seen it all.  Camera tricks are good.  Don't let the timing fool you, a lot of flashbacks can make this movie confusing. Sit down and watch it and you will enjoy it.	8
 GOOD IF YOU CAN HANDLE IT!!	This may be based around a subgect that has the potential to be disturbing and some scene were in this film, but all up this film was pretty good. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker (Se7en, Brainscan, The Game) which is a reason for watching it, some great acting be Nicholas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix. The story is A small, seemingly innocuous plastic reel of film leads surveillance specialist Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) down an increasingly dark and frightening path. With the help of the streetwise Max (Joaquin Phoenix), Welles relentlessly follows a bizarre trail of evidence to determine the fate of a complete stranger. As his work turns into obsession, he drifts farther and farther away from his wife (Catherine Keener), family and simple life as a small-town private eye. All up some disturbing parts, not unbearable but all up a good watch if you can handle it.	8
 An impressive thriller	"This film is packed with excitement, suspense, and some interesting plot twists.  Nicolas Cage delivers an exceptional performance as P.I. Tom Welles, trying to solve what will become the most challenging case of his life. The film takes us into the seedy underbelly of Hollywood, where pornography becomes its most extreme and sickening.  The picture definitely does not attempt to ""sugar coat"" the industry and portrays it as it really is.  As P.I. Welles gets deeper into the case, he discovers that things are not always as they appear to be.  The picture is somewhat disturbing in some parts, but the violence is never glorified. I personally enjoyed this film very much.  It had enough action and suspense to keep me on the edge of my seat, but it is definitely not for the faint of heart.  Great performances and an interesting plot really make this film one not to be missed."	8
 A disturbing film yet compulsive to watch.	"Eight Millimetre is a very disturbing film, yet a very well made film as well. It's the sort of film that everyone really should see, but no-one would blame you if you didn't! The film makes you wonder ""How on earth did the censor let them get away with that!"", yet, in its own way, its a very strong argument against censorship, because the disturbing turns the story takes are what make the film such a unique and realistic portrayal of a very bad part of life.Nicholas Cage plays a private investigator who is called upon to investigate a snuff film, which was found in a safe after a wealthy man's death. The question his widow wants to know is - is the man she adored and to whom she was married for forty-five years really the distinguished gentleman she has always believed him to be, or was he a mentally-disturbed pervert who gets kicks out of watching innocent young girls being killed? And, worse still, did he pay for the girl to be killed on film, for his pleasure, when there were no other snuff films available?In order to find out, the investigator has to get down into the gutter of life, and search through the worst and most perverted porno manufacturing networks he can find. The girl went missing six years ago, and the police haven't got a clue, but there are clues on the film, such as a tattoo on the hand of the masked killer, and a fleeting image of a man in the background watching.So what exactly is so disturbing about this film? In order to explain properly, I'm going to have to write a SPOILER. So please only read on ONLY (a) if you have already seen the film, or (b) if you are completely sure you're not going to see it, or (c) if you want to know exactly why it's disturbing and don't mind knowing what happens in order to find out. OK? Here we go:        *******WARNING: ******* SPOILER ******* SPOILER *******The Disturbing Features:The film is disturbing largely because the investigator is so shocked by what he discovers that he brutally murders the girl's killers, and gets away with it as well. He literally gets down into the same moral gutter that they are in.Another disturbing feature is that, in order to make himself angry enough to start killing, he cruelly calls the dead girl's mother on the phone, tells her how her daughter was killed, six years ago. When she naturally breaks down into hysterical sobs, crying out ""No, no, no! I love my little girl!"" it helps him to start the killing, just as he'd hoped.Another disturbing feature is that he insensitively calls the widow who started the investigation, and blurts out that her husband did indeed commission the film, and paid for the killing, so the elderly widow, unable to cope with the sudden dreadful news, commits suicide.And yet another disturbing event is that right at the end, he receives a letter from the girl's mother, emphasising that he did the right thing, in murdering her child's killers. So basically, this film is saying ""Forget about the police. They'll do nothing for six years or more. If someone has killed a child, the best thing to do is to take the law into your own hands.""Some people on the internet who are concerned with pro-life issues, have been arguing that the message of the film also carries strong implications that those who shoot abortionists may be doing the right thing, the best thing, after all."	9
 Good movie for almost the entire running time	This was a good, atmospheric film  for about 9/10 of the running time, then it reaches a climax and curiously keeps on going. The movie has a good atmosphere and is an interesting look into the world of underground porn, the problems mainly lie in the fact that cage is not a great actor and ends up as 2-dimensional as everyone else in the film. The most irritating thing about this movie was the fact that the ending beats you over the head with the point. For the most part fans of thrillers arent dumb, although it seems the director doesnt realize that. 7/10 in my opinion, worth seeing but not paying to see.	
 Boy can that Cage boy act. . .	I sat to watch this movie not exactly knowing what to expect.  I must say that I was shocked and amazed that things such as this happen.  The two major drawbacks to this movie are its length (got a bit long towards the end) and the constant look of disturbance on Nick Cage's face.  That boy be preturbed.  Anyway, this movie is good as long as you know what you're getting into, and even better if you don't.	9
 Once you've seen it you cannot forget it.	As usual Nic Cage is able to take the dark side of his own persona- which he readily admits he has- and use it to give depth to his character.  It is the small things- flinching at what he sees on the screen, tacking Mary Ann's picture to the motel wall that gives his performance depth.  This is a disturbing movie- it haunted me for hours after I had seen it- truly- it probes the underbelly of life- where the maggots crawl-- worst of all- it's the respectable people who can be the rottenest inside.  Joacquim Phoenix really played well with Cage- almost like a robin to a batman... Not for the weak at heart- but a film that asks some tough questions and the answers are not pretty at all...	8
 A good movie that makes you think	I thought this movie was very good. Although the subject matter is a little disturbing and people who are very sensitive to it might feel squeamish but because you dont like the subject matter is no reason to diss a movie.People know in general what this movie is about before they see it. It was a different and unusual storyline that makes people think about all the weirdos there are out there. Nicholas Cage did great as the P.I. as well as Joaquin Phoenix as the store clerk.	8
 The best Schumacher's work.	"I love this one for the good plot, good actors' play, especially were good Nicolas Cage, Peter Stomare, James Gandolfini and finally director's work. I think Joel Schumacher made the best movie in his career. I watched it with big pleasure and ""8mm"" made an impression on me. Some moments was difficult to watch for strong violence. But it didn't spoil the movie."	
 A very dark movie about a very dark subject!!	"This movie deals with a man who is sent to find who made a ""snuff"" film for a old man . What he does not know , it will take into the underground of the porn industry. This movie did fare well at the box office ,for what reason I do not know!!??what it cage? or the director ? maybe now that it is out to rent more people will rent it and discover this little unknown movie with big name stars. Overall, I like the movie ,just it leaves me feel with a bad after taste in my mouth . If you can handle the subject matter ,then go enjoy this very dark and awesome movie!!!BTW, the soundtrack is just as dark,creepy as this movie!!!even if you do not like porn in any shape or form , this movie should be a must for parents of little children  and especially teenagers!!!the parents might learn something from this movie!!know where you children are at all times so they can stay out of trouble!!!"	8
 GOOD ACTION THRILLER	8MM               I think this is a good movie because of the way it shows you how things happen that wouldent cross your mind normally. This movie is a action thriller, about a rich man who dies, and a 8mm film that his wife finds while going through his safe.The wife highers a PI {Nicholas Cage} to investigate to see who the girl on the film was and if she had really beeen killed. Nicholas Cage finds every one he can who would know about these kinds of movies,so he could find out who the man behind the mask was, who supposedly killed the girl in a snuff film,and when he does it will catch you off guard because off the reality behind it.                   by srv student Zach	
 disturbing but compelling thriller	"Tom Welles try's to find out if 8mm of film he saw is real or fake. This takes him on a dark journey into the porn underground. Tom watches a lot of porn movies with the porn store clerk. Max seems to be against all that porn stuff despite the fact he works in a porn store and knows a lot about the underground. Tom Welles really begins to become obsessed and even a bit crazy as he gets closer to the truth. A shocking and disturbing thriller with a frightening and compelling story. They should show this movie at that school for John's. Want to turn someone away from the porn industry show them this movie. ""Dance with the devil and the devil don't change; the devil changes you."" Max"	8
 An eye opener. Dark and wonderful. Cage at his finest. Not for the queasy.		9
 Weird, but watchable	8MM is certainly a unique movie.  No copycatting here.  I found it somewhat enjoyable in that it held my attention.  However, as I watched I found myself waiting for the BIG shocker.  It didn't really come.  There were only 2 possibilities.  The snuff film was fake or it was real.  That's it.  I don't think that it was a lack of shock, but rather another example of how desensitized to violence we've become.  I was not shocked.  I felt that I could sit through the snuff type films.  In actuality, who knows?  I may toss my cookies.  I don't know.  My other point has to do with James Gandolfini.  Boy, Mr. Tony Soprano is sure getting around.  He plays the sicko way too comfortably.  He's starting to become typecast as either a slobbish psycho, or a secretive type with a conscious (Al Love in A Civil Action and, oh yeah, Tony Soprano).  At any rate, 8MM was a decent movie, but let's not alert the Academy.	
 Excellent film with two flaws	"This is a very well-made, non-exploitive or pandering look at an incredibly vile realm of human vice.  Two major problems take away points:1.  It's been done before.  ""Cruising"" (1980), the much-maligned film about a vice cop undercover, in the gay S&M milieu, who ends up a part of it. Same subject, different treatment. 2.  There is a clichéd sub-plot of the neglected hero's wife, and her anguish at what the job is doing to her man.  Sound familiar?There are drugs, and there are drugs; there is porn, and there is porn.  We all know that.  This excellent film visits a subject that needs no amplification.  If society encounters real snuff film makers, it knows what to do."	8
 truthfull	"this film brings forth the truth... the society's very truth that is not beautiful or noble, but rather filthy and evil... the film's exploitation is not in sex or action, but in telling an ordinary man's ordeal amidst the society's evil... the film does not present the ugliness with veil of cinematographic tricks... nor does it attempt to resolve every agony and pain with climatic-but-happy ending... the film leaves the audience with the inevitable thoughts... to wonder about the existence of evil, its purpose, its effects... and why it exists... nicholas cage's character is not heroic or innately protected from pain or guilt... he faces what only a very few sees, the underbelly of the society... and makes decisions and committs actions... as an ""ordinary"" man would, not as a holywood action hero would..."	8
 Not Cages best, but still very gripping tale.	The movie is a mystery where Cage plays an Investigator trying to ascertain the validity or authenticity of an 8mm film. Overall the film, is quite well done. However,I found that some scenes at the start of the movie were somewhat weak. Like when Cage watches the film. I am sure many will not agree. I feel that a person like Cage would be 'hardened' enough to handle the film better than he did.Having said that, the rest of the film draws the viewer in superbly. Suspense is masterfully created. Well worth watching. 8/10	
 The Dark Side of the Porno Entertainment Industry.	"A gripping movie that keeps you on the edge all the way through. Seeing what ""Good Guy"" Tom finds out, learns to deal with and finally drives him to deliver much deserved punishment will stay with you for long after the movie is over.All characters are believable to the point you wonder if this kind of tragedy really happens.  Nick goes through a change he never dreamed possible.  I was surprised but I think I understood and still believe his ""Tom"" did the right things.If anything, maybe this film will make a few young girls avoid the wild, dangerous side of the video/film industry.Worth Seeing!"	9
 Good movie all around	"I've always considered Schumacher a rather artless and dull director but I think he proved us (at least me) wrong with this film.  Because of all the outrage over this film I just had to see it...and as it turns out it is a surprisingly good film.  The best thing a movie can do is to transport the viewer into another time, place or situation...whether the vision is ugly or angelic, comforting or disturbing.  Otherwise, why bother to sit through one and have it serve up the comfortable and familiar all over again (which must be at least 90% of the movies out there).  8mm is disturbing, but so what. The monsters in 8mm truly exist...whether the public gets outraged or not. It be nice if the world was a warm and fuzzy ""When Harry Met Sally"" place to live in...but alas.... My only gripe about the movie is it contained a few too many ""hollywood"" film moments and cliches...a few too many guns just out of the hero's reach and too many instances of talkative villains at crucial moments....good stuff all around though....."	
 I'm surprised to say that...	I'm surprised to say that this movie could have been better. (one thing only) Why were they using cap gun sounds when guns were fired??  But... I really enjoyed this movie.  I also feel that the character in the movie Max California acted really well in the movie.  I didn't notice any flaws at all.  I also felt that Cages acting was great too... let you know.  See this movie... but like others say... know what you are getting into before you see this.  I wasn't disappointed. (except for the gun sounds)  If they used real guns sounds I feel that this movie would be just about flawless. It had a nice ending too.	
 An emotion-shredding experience that's hard to forget	"Everyone is relaxed at the beginning of the film.  As the ""plot thickens"" as they say, the room begins to tense.  Just when you think you are going to shield your eyes from the inevitable, you find yourself unwilling to miss even the slightest moment of the thriller.  Although is contains very provocative themes and momentary scenes, most of the sexuality is suggested. Which is to say that even the suggestion is shocking enough.  It tests your will to stomach some of society's most controversial social deformities. And answers the reoccuring question, ""How far would you go to know?"""	9
 Interesting.	Hardly ever do I see a film where the last 30 minutes are better than the rest of the film combined. 8MM is a good film, but it all plays like a typical murder mystery until the end. Toward the end characters are stuck asking some pretty tough questions of themselves and not liking the answers they find. Cage does a very good job playing a private investigator basically, who didn't know this underworld of illegal pornography existed. Phoenix is in for some comic relief, but I want to say something about James Gandolfini. Gandolfini plays Eddie Poole. Ayone familiar with his work should pay attention to one of the most natural actors I have ever seen. Eddie Poole could have been a cardboard cut-out, instead he is very hard to forget. I've never really been a big fan of Joel Schumacher's work and I didn't love this film, but the scenes at the end are examples that Schumacher has real talent. Just keep Joel Shumacher away from the Batman franchise.	6
 An overall acceptable film...but amazing in some parts.	"This movie was good.  Strange, exciting, disturbing images and an ""All Too Real"" plot that makes you think long and hard on the subjects.Cage is good through the entire film...and I doubt any other actor would have fit as well into the part.But what REALLY got to me was the climatic scene where Cage calls the girl's mother, and asks her permission to take revenge on the men who killed her.I can't stress enough how powerful that scene was, and I hope people notice it as I have.Overall, a good film...just prepare yourself.  Either to be shocked, sickened, disturbed, or...at the very least...for an amazing performance by Cage."	8
 Are we that desensitized?		7
 A film to make you think!	This film was excellent!  The plot's involvement with the porn industry would make anyone despise the industry.  The film opens people's eyes to the filth that is present in our world today and may even spur people on to take some kind of action.  The cinematography was very good and the camera was used effectivley.  The editing was likewise!  If the film was disturbing in a negatie way like some people have said then wouldn't the censors have it banned?  8 mm has a morale tale behind it that is clear enough for everyone to understand.  See this film and learn!	
 It won't happen to my daughter!	"On the face of it, this is a story about how a private detective put his feelings too deep in an assignment involving disturbed people. Despite such a seemingly pedestrian plot, I was drawn ever deeper into the movie as Cage's stone-faced yet soulful disposition broke down into that of remorse, hatred and dilemma. Schumacher's formulaic treatment works better for me here than in 7 -- 8mm is intense with a purpose, dark with a light at the end of the tunnel, slow with just the right amount of anticipation, seedy with a kind of slickness that compels disgusted viewers to glue their eyes on the action. IMHO really one notch up as the numeral in the title suggests...Also, unlike too many goody-two-shoe films of the same breed, this one actually lets Cage's character gratify his hatred of the villains. It is NOT a story about righteousness, because if someone you care for were the victim of such heinous brutality you will want to skin the murderers yourself even if that can't bring her back. Somewhere in 8mm is also probably a lesson for legions of Mary-Ann's out there who would want to run away to become ""Hollywood stars."""	8
 Disturbing as they come, but also a great film	"8MM is definitely not for everyone, a few groups of people left during the final half hour and I really can't blame them.  It's definitely one of the most disturbing films I have seen in a very long time but thanks to another great script by Andrew Kevin Walker it succeeds very well.  Nicolas Cage pulls off yet another great performance and it was nice to see Joel Shumacher get out of his Batman & Robin style and take this film seriously. The issues in this film are very serious and are taken to extreme, the whole part about ""snuff"" films is highly disturbing and graphic but it needs to be.  All the performances are well delivered and the story line goes through many twists that bring a similar resemblance to Seven in mind.  The only thing that was disappointing about it was the music which sounded like something you'd hear in Dances With Wolves.  But other than that, I'd recommend it to anyone who can sit through something disturbing who also must have a strong stomach."	10
 Hold your breath! Cage's coming!	"When I prepared to visit the theater to watch 8MM, I thought that Denzel Washington was playing the main character. I still don't know what made me think like that. When I realised that is was Nicolas Cage I came to the conclusion that this was a film to catapult him from second row to first. His voice during the film, his behaviour, his ""familiarity"" is just 100% ""Cage"" as I know him from previous movies. Well, I liked the movie but sometimes it seemed to me that the director's wishes and Cage's abilities (or disabilities) were in conflict. Anyway, the world of 1999 needed this movie and the people who made it did their job good. Applause!"	10
 Disturbing but well crafted.	The subject matter is grim and the plot is dark. The movie nonetheless approaches a disturbing subject in a sensitive way.There are no overtly graphic scenes and although I came out of the Cinema wondering what possessed me to go and see the movie in the first place, it did, in retrospect make me wonder about the depths of human depravity and the sadness and desperation of the innocent victims of that depravity.	6
 Good up to a point		
 Accept that life is not always pretty	8mm turned out to be a completely different film to what I initially thought it would be. But nevertheless, it ended up being just as entertaining. I believe that Nicolas Cage was completely outshone by Joaquin Phoenix, and it was just unfortunate that Joaquin's character took away any possibility of development. 8mm, and other films similar to it allow society the ability to comprehend that there is more to life than the circle you live in. Sometimes a trip to the other side is required to notice where exactly you fit into the grand scheme of things. Although Seven is a completely different film, you can see the parallels between the two, and I'ts fulfilling though saddening and frightening to see the dark canker underworld that in a sense, supports our society. 8mm was as dark and damaged as Seven was and indeed cements a permanent foothold in my list of favourite films.	8
 Maybe I´m a pervert for saying this, but --I LOVE THIS MOVIE	"Screenwriter for 8MM is Andrew Kevin Walker, who also wrote the awesome Se7en. Even if I hate comparing these two films (everyone does it...damn), I have to admit that these two films have much in common. The atmosphere of realistic disgust, great plot, great acting, and EXCELLENT ending. Both films also break many Hollywood cliches. Now for 8MM itself. Unfortunately, I still havent seen Leaving Las Vegas (damn me...Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor and I haven't seen his Oscar role), but Nicolas Cage´s Tom  Wells MUST have been his next best performance to LLV at least. Other actors did a great job as well (Joaquin Phoenix as Max California or Peter Stormare as ""Jarmusch of porn"" Dino Velvet). Joel Schumacher did a good job as well (almost as good as David Fincher). The music was stunning....exotic rythms from Arabia...that's what I call a refreshing music after all those Horners, Zimmers etc. I can't help myself, but since I´ve seen 8MM I have to think about it. Like Max said : ""There are things, that you're going to see, that you can´t unsee. They get in your head and they stay there."" In short....a dark, depressing and all around awesome thriller. In my opinion 8MM IS better than Se7en. Definitely worth seeing."	10
 A Marvelous, Yet Disturbing Film. One To Watch - Once.		10
 A GREAT DARK PICTURE. VERY WELL DONE	Although it has a weak beginning, for the first 5 to 10 minutes, from there on you are lead downwards a place you suspect exists but have not really seen. The color and choreography of the picture resemble very much of seven, but it is not seven part II, it is perhaps, a lot darker, and, at the end, with a nearly happy end. If you liked seven you won´t be disappointed by this film.	
 A good thriller and a better Cage	On the good side the thriller has rhythm and a Nicholas Cage whose performance is never above the lines. On the bad side I see only the end of the film where, following already seen American patterns, the good kills the evil, a private justice, the old western law, something that in Europe would have probably seen the arrival of the Police or far less violence. In the Italian version (120 min) there is violence, but the thing that mostly disturbs is the environment shown, an environment that is probably not only fruit of the director imagination: It is sad to see how far can human mind go and that should induce people to think. So a good film that forces to think and opens a window over an obscure world.	7
 Graphically stimulating and disturbing	Wow. Talk about a movie. 8mm takes the viewer on a rough journey through the underworlds of the sex/pornography industry. Prepare yourself for graphic language and crude sexual content. The film's rating is just on the brink of a NC-17 stamp. This one is definitely not a date movie.	8
 A film you love or you hate	Saw this twice when on Honeymoon in New York.  Loved it.  It's good to have a truly dark film now and again.  Don't go and see this if you want a comfortable evening out, and certainly don't go and see it if you're looking for a date film.It also has the best film score I've heard in years.	8
 Disturbing and Surprising Thriller	Ok, this is not,as stated on the cover of this month's Uncut 'The most disturbing US movie since Seven'(That would be Happiness).But it comes pretty close.Of course It's not perfect - The Dino Velvet character is just too over the line, and some of the settings are too Goth/industrial/NiN to be true - but as a whole I really enjoyed it.	8
 Disturbing but Entertaining	"All I needed to hear about this movie to get me to see it was that it was written by Andrew Kevin Walker of ""Seven,"" one of my favorite movies. After the abysmal ""Batman and Robin"" and ""Snake Eyes"" I was worried that Joel Schumacher and Nicolas Cage might might mess it up, but both did a fine job. This movie is not quite as good as ""Seven,"" but how many films are? It has several interesting performances including Cage as a detective, Joaquin Phoenix as video store clerk and Peter Stormare (the nearly mute killer in ""Fargo"") as a porn auteur. ""8MM"" is very, very dark, but that is to be expected from a movie about snuff films. It could have just been a soulless attempt to shock the audience, but I found it very involving and interesting. Even I was surprised at some of the material about the ultra-hardcore sex trade they were able to get in under the R rating. Those who have a difficult time with such things will most likely call the film garbage, those who can look past the subject matter will find much to appreciate in the clever but disturbing screenplay and the bleak, evocative art direction."	8
 VERY good, but not the kind of movie I expected	"I was very surprised by this movie. I think that you can call me a movie freak, and Nicolas is my favorite actor. Mostly when I see that there's an interesting movie in production, I ""study"" the movie. I download the trailer, gather information, things like that. After I did all that for 8mm, I had a certain impression of the movie. I expected a kind of movie like ""Kiss The Girls"". When the movie came out, I went to see it. It was totally different. The ambiance in the movie is one I never saw or felt before. I think especially the art direction and certain actors (Joaquin Phoenix, Peter Stormare) helped to create the ambiance. Besides all that, the storyline is good and very surprising, and Nicolas Cage once again proved why he has won an Oscar."	
 Never done before	"I liked this movie in the sense that this subject was quite new and that it was covered in a different way (the murder story). What I liked: I appreciated that we saw the ordinary life of this private detective compared to this living hell...I knew that perversity can go very far but I didn't knew that it could be shown like this or sold on such open ""market"" (at least in the US) I didn't know that Hollywood had this reverse medal also.What I didn't like: The revenge of the private detective was too "" American hero stereotype"" especially the scene in the graveyard ! But I guess (or hope) they made it in purpose as an eyeblink to Hollywood B- films.Conclusion: I will advise to see this movie but you have first to like Nicolas Cage (it will help)."	8
 The best since Seven	One more time Joel Schumacher shows as that he can do better things than Batman movies. He takes us in a world of movies we hardly know. He shows us like in Falling Down how a person, Nicholas Cage , can change during the film. For me 8MM is an excellent movie, and I hope more directors would do more films of this kind.	10
 Dark Movie, but very original and good!		
 I like it!		9
 Unique & Suspenseful	This movie started off a bit slow but then it did get you on the edge of your seat!! Nic did a GREAT job & as most of the other cast members did. Especially Eddie, he did an excellent job!! This movie showed a bit more then I anticipated, though I was not offended! This really goes on in this weird world & it is reality. I think Nic definitely takes chances in his roles & Tom Welles was a perfect example. I ALWAYS enjoy watching Nic perform & grow as an actor. This movie is sad but thrilling! Two thumbs up from me!!!!!!!	8
 8MM is a Far Reach!	8MM is a far reach from what I was expecting.  The movie stars Nicolas Cage and although I have always been impressed by his work this movie just falls short of his true talent.The movie dragged on for too long and didn't achieve much other than eye popping pornography and sick plot twists.  It rarely got too in-depth with any of the plot and had several sub-plots that just didn't seem necessary for the movie.A few short comments:  Too long, too much pornography, too much bad acting, not enough depth in the plot, bland ending.	6
 Just as good as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS	In 1991 Jonathan Demme brought us the fabulous SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. It was a movie that was terrifying, suspenseful, and flat out - a masterpiece!Now, it's 1999 and we get a movie equally as wonderful (I didn't see se7en so don't say I am being stupid by saying it wasn't as good as sotl) We get 8MM.8MM is about a guy trying to solve a murder which was filmed. It is extremely suspenseful and could be one of the finest feature films I have ever seen!However, if HALLOWEEN and FRIDAY THE 13th were too much for you, don't dare go near this movie. It is extremely disturbing (not intended for the weak at heart or for any other thirteen year olds like myself)	
 Above average thriller.	A very competent thriller, with enough originality to stand out from the average offering of the genre. The plunge of the straight-laced detective into the world of sexual perversion is well depicted, if at times a bit naively. A few plot twists seem a bit contrived, however, and the film is occasionally slightly slow in its pace.Good acting overall. Cage is decent, while Joaquin Phoenix is excellent as a symbolic Virgil to Cage's Dante. Despite being written by Andrew Kevin Walker, it falls well short of being a new 'Se7en'.	8
 Great thrills, but not for the squeamish	"A dark and disturbing thriller reminiscent of ""Seven"" (surprise - same screenwriter). After his ""Batman""-flicks, I did not expect Schumacher to come back to form, but this is almost a masterpiece. When Nicolas Cage sets out to discover the origins of a ""snuff"" movie, he is forced on a trip down into the deepest pits of human perversion, learning things about himself and man in general that nobody would like to know about. And we are forced to go with him. Cage's performance is flawless. Like his ""Snake Eyes"", ""8MM"" is also about the act of seeing and film-making. Peter Stormare is over-the-top as the ""Jim Jarmush of porn"", but nothing compared to ""Machine"" (the guy with the leather mask). Be prepared for some really nasty twists, gross sexual details, and abandon all hope for nice and decent Hollywood entertainment. I loved it."	8
 Why Cage why???????	Wow. What a shock to see Nicholas Cage in such a dog of a movie. This (quite frankly) joins such other savory films like 'Death Wish 2', 'I Spit On Your Grave,' and 'Mothers Day.' While a movie about crime is supposed to have logic, this one is just a series of dumb killings. A friend of mine who owns a video store said this was one of the worst investments he ever made. Once word got quickly around how BAD this movie was, the movie just sat on the shelf and collected dust.	1
 8mm is postmodern nonsense	Any movie with a plot about a wealthy pervert paying one million dollars to pornographers to produce a 1992 snuff movie with a jumpy and grainy hand held 8mm movie camera should be an early warning that this film must be as defective as the cameraman (with obvious advanced Parkinson's disease) who operated the camera while the victim was being killed. The movie had a horror comic book style with its background of Gotham City slums, retro-technology and cartoonish characters. The bad guys have adopted sleeze as a total life style, i.e., they not only have sleezy jobs, they wear sleezy clothes, decorate their offices with junk store discounts, and prefer to live in urban slums. Tom Welles (Nicholas Cage) is a private eye who is able to learn the identity of the snuff film victim with a lot of improbable good luck. He plods through the film with the energy of someone with low blood pressure! The film is neither disturbing or exciting. It is boring and stupid!	1
 Massively Under-Rated		9
 Seems a mechanical exercise, with little passion for the material evident...	"The whole film feels as if it was designed by committee in the wake of (I would guess) the relatively unexpected success of ""Se7en"". As if scriptwriter Andrew Kevin Walker and the studio honchos sat down and said: ""OK, audiences obviously love the dark stuff, so what is suitably dark and borderline sickening for our next project? I know, a film about the 'snuff movie' culture!"" Little attempt has been made to 'energize' the material, on the basis that the premise should be intriguing enough in itself to pull the punters in. By 'energize', I don't mean presenting the characters as 'happy go lucky' and setting events to a poppy soundtrack. This would obviously be inappropriate for the subject matter. What I mean is, this feels like the sort of film you or I would make about 'snuff' movies, one with - I'm speaking for myself and hopefully most other people here - no authentic knowledge of what these things are actually like, instead relying on clichés and probable urban myth to give some substance to an incredibly sketchy idea. Did they speak to any 'experts' on the matter? If they did, then the fault must surely lie with director Schumacher for failing to do anything remotely interesting with the material.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)The argument that the film is intended to be 'downbeat, hard-hitting and gritty' might have held water were it not for the laughable schism that affects Cage's character towards the end of the film. He goes from jaded and sickened everyman detective to righteous avenging angel, which may have been believable had there been a stage in between! Instead, what we get is Cage lumbering around like a zombie one minute, and indulging in Batfink 'your bullets cannot harm me...' style heroics the next. (NB: 'Batfink' is a cult cartoon character, for those of you too sheltered or culturally deprived to get the reference!) Joaquin Phoenix's character is the only 'bright spot' in the movie.It is vaguely disturbing, but no more disturbing than your own imagination would be if you were to ruminate on the subject. This is seriously disappointing, because it doesn't tell or show us anything we didn't already know or couldn't guess. I get the feeling that this is because this was seen as a commercially viable companion piece to ""Se7en"" rather than an intriguing exploration in its own right. ""Se7en"" tackles its own dark themes with much more style, intelligence and insight. There is definite potential for an interesting movie on such a subject to be made. This is not it."	3
 Very Nice Performances, Clumsy Script.	"Nicholas Cage is a professional surveillance guy, rather like Gene Hackman in ""Conversation"". He has a loving wife, Keener, and a cute kiddy. He's hired in one of those ""spare no expense"" deals to find out who is behind a real snuff film that an elderly widow just found in her long-dead, filthy rich husband's private safe.We see at once that Cage is a nice, middle-class guy, who cares about people's feelings, and he's going to do the best job as a private investigator that he can.So he takes a good hard look at the snuff film. There are three men involved on the scratchy old print. One of them, wearing a black mask and Goth gear, butchers a pretty young sixteen-year-old girl. The director doesn't show us the slaughter, thank God, but we see Cage's repulsion, slightly overdone.He hasn't much to go on. The film is six years old and nobody is identifiable. But like any good PI he visits porno store after porno store until he finds a guide, Phoenix, working behind the counter, a kind of Cumaean Sibyl who guides him into the underworld of smoky caverns where men and younger girls do things that men and younger girls are not supposed to do.And here the story, written by Andrew Kevin Walker, begins to wobble. All the dens of iniquity look pretty much alike, although they're supposed to be sequentially a deeper peek into perversion. The voyage that follows is accompanied by a very loud Hindi chant full of tablas and wailing, inappropriate and unconscionable. The tale continues as Cage and Phoenix track down the three culprits, who turn out to be Stormare (great in ""Fargo""), Gandolfini, and the butcher in the mask, a nobody and something of a Mamma's boy despite his flabby heft.Two thirds of the way through, the film collapses in on itself, piece by piece, with little in the way of redeeming value. I'll give an example of a redeeming incident though. It's a piece of dialog. Peter Stormare, the snuff film's director and photographer, has just been shot through the neck and is doing his dying swan fall to the floor. ""Not this way, not this way,"" he mutters to himself. ""It should be something more CINEMATIC."" It's not only the funniest line in the film; it's the ONLY funny line.I'll give one example of how to turn a story that begins with some promise into a commercial piece of mindless garbage. A lot of film time is lavished on Catherine Keener as Cage's wife, although they're not often seen together on the screen. However, they're constantly calling one another, each time signing off with, ""I love you"", followed by the other's ""I love you."" I figured, okay, Keener -- with that aquiline nose and those alarming zygomatic arches -- is a splendid actress. She really is. So she's going to be kidnapped, along with their baby, right? Wrong. She's never in jeopardy. So why is she so prominently featured. So that after all that lovey-dovey stuff she can torment the already abused Cage by taking the tot and leaving him. (Not to worry, she returns at the end, with no realistic excuse either for leaving in the first place or for returning.) And here's how she tells Cage she's leaving. The poor guy has just had the hell kicked and beaten out of him. He manages to stumble all bloody into his home and Keener begins shrieking at him -- ""Look at yourself!"" and ""How do you think I FEEL not knowing where you are?"" It's a typical conflict between cop and wife. (Cf., for instance, ""Heat."") But there has been absolutely no hint of the magnitude, or even the existence, of her dissatisfaction before. It comes out of nowhere except the writer's desire to add still more dramatic fluff to a movie about an already sordid subject.I was pretty disgusted by this point. The climax is the usual mud wrestling in a cemetery. When two men fight and one is armed, the gun or knife is generally knocked from the hand and there is an obligatory shot of the weapon skittering along the floor. In this movie -- FOUR TIMES. We're no longer in the realm of imagination but of a ritual shot that is almost religious in its invariability.And yet, despite the terrible let-down, those performances can't be easily dismissed. Not a clinker in the bunch. They sparkle among the rain-drenched, littered, dark streets of the ugly part of New York, the leafless barren hills of Appalachia, and the gloomy cellars of Los Angeles.Want a name of a particularly appealing actress? The dead girl's mother, living alone in a wretched shack somewhere in rural Pennsylvania or West Virginia, dying to get Cage to sit down and join her for dinner or at least a drink. Not for sex but to relieve for a few minutes the social vacuum she seems locked into. Her name is Amy Morton. And her part may be the best-written in the film."	6
 Effective music	"There isn't much to say about the film - its supposed to be a descent into hell, but Cage is a pretty boy non-actor and the director couldn't be bothered with fixing the bits that don't quite work. The result is a flawed melodrama that can call itself dark on the posters.The music however is worth talking about. The strange Peruvian(?) melodies that go with views of LA porn are nicely disconcerting. Also good use of silence marks the domestic scenes out from the rest of the investigation.And the masked killer playing Aphex Twins ""Come to Daddy"" on vinyl shows that someone did at least have a genuinely good ear for Freudian depth."	
 Schumacher tries to be Fincher ... and fails	"I can't really say that I liked ""Se7en"" (although I think it's a good movie) - but at least it stayed in my head for a long time and Andrew Kevin Walker's script is surely one of the reasons for that. But this will not happen for ""8MM"" - and this is probably due to Schumacher's way of putting a promising idea on screen. Many people that submitted a comment on this movie found it ""disturbing"", ""dark"", ""sick"" - I think it was mainly a standard Hollywood thriller with a slightly off-Hollywood subject. Just the fact that the movie deals with underground pornography and snuff films doesn't make it disturbing - a better insight into the characters and their demons would have. Cage's transformation from loving family man to angry avenger is quite unmotivated and many scenes are just soo typical Hollywood thriller-like. I would've liked to see a believable descent down into the personal hell of the main character; ""Se7en"" did that; in a way Friedkin's ""Cruising"" did that; ""8MM"" didn't. Next time I will need more than one good reason (like a script by Walker) to watch a Joel Schumacher movie."	4
 Vile.		1
 Not recommended!	"I give this movie 10/10 because I think this movie has a real story to it, it feels all too real and it makes you sick while watching it. I can't say I would recommend this movie to anyone to see, but it is a movie people should see not because it's such a great movie, well it is, but because it's about real people and a story that could happen. I do how ever hope that people never do anything like this because I want to believe in peoples goodness. The acting is great if not even awesome, the story is ""too real"" and I can see the Joel Schumacher in this film as well as others, he is one of my favorite filmmakers through the time because of movies like this one. Even if I do not want to recommend this movie it is one of the best movies I ever saw."	10
 Tremendously dark, perfectly made.	"""8 mm"" is one of those movies that you won't easily forget because of it's violent, dark nature of it's content and because it makes you think if it's possible that these kind of events happen in real life.Please do not think about this movie as the typical cop/detective flick with violent tones. ""8 mm"" is more than that; it's a moving experience in all the negative sense of the word. Let me explain myself...The events of this movie will make you feel angst, anger, and even fear due to the nastiness of the mafia surrounding the main plot.The Director digs on the snuff film plot but the main focus on the movie is all about the mafias that control a not very well known market of violence and torture.Also, ""8 mm"" succeeds on the Criminology aspects because it has to do with private investigation, judicial searching, and black markets. The ending has a great impact on the audience because it's filled with violence, sadness, and pity. You get to understand the nature of the evil of the villains.Please give this movie a chance and you won't regret; it's truly one of the most dark but powerful movies of the past twenty years. Seriously underrated. Be sure to get this feature that perfectly mixes action, thriller, and even horror.Special mention for Joaquin Phoenix for his portray as Max California. An impressive performance."	9
 A good movie in some ways, a bad one in others.		6

 What Could Have Been		
 Very good but disturbing film	This movie made me very uncomfortable, and the idea of these things really happening scared me. The movie (by which I mean the first hour or so, because I haven't seen the rest) was very tense and very graphic (which caused me to zap away more than once, take a deep breath, than zap back again) The point is that I still RETURNED to watching this movie, because it had me sitting on the edge of my chair the whole time. A must-see if you have a strong stomach and good nerves. Don't watch this if you are not good with violence (like 13-year-old me) or find the many nauseating sexual scenes disturbing (me again). I give this movie 3/5.	
 I wish someone had warned me....		3
 Slick and empty	"Approximately 9 1/2 hours into this excruciatingly pointless film, I found myself wondering if there was a reason behind this movie other than to be another ready-made ""disturbing"" box-office hit.  And sadly, I found no reasons.The trend of each new Hollywood thriller attempting to be more grotesque than the previous one is getting more depressing by the minute.  In true pandering fashion, the filmmakers use ""The Silence of the Lambs"" as their model and attempt to copy everything except the things that are beyond their grasp -- coherent story, pointed dialogue, symbolism.  This is not a surprise from either the director (""Batman and Robin"" anyone?) or the writer (""Seven"", another cog in the wheel of this particular trend).  Nor, unfortunately, is it a surprise for this film's talented and engaging leading man.If you think too much about this film, it becomes laughable almost instantly.  If you put your brain on hold and attempt to enjoy it that way, you'll simply be bored.  To make matters worse, the film ends in a dramatically valid way...then meanders on for a particularly ridiculous and unfounded 20 minutes more!          POSSIBLE SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If you must watch, note how Nicolas Cage's character undergoes a rather hilarious shift from the nicest man in the universe to a raging dispenser of vigilante justice in the final quarter of the film.  I was left wondering whether this was a result of his exposure to underground pornography or his desire to dispense with all of these cardboard characters!Overall, yet another attempt to dress up sickening subject matter in a glossy, nicely wrapped package with nothing inside of it except the filmmakers' desire to make some quick cash."	3
 A VERY DISTURBING FILM, BEWARE!	This movie should be rated NC-17. I watched this with my mom thinking it would be one of the many great movies with the talented Nicolas Cage in it. I thought it was only about a murder case. Little did I know, it was very graphic and disturbing. It is highly NOT recommended for people under 18 at all. I am between 13 and 15 and I absolutely hated it. It was very very disturbing for me. I woke up at 3am in the morning with scenes from the movie still running through my head. This movie was rather confusing to me. I didn't really understand certain parts of it. It was also somewhat tiring. I give the rating of 3 because of the disturbance in my sleep and the pervertiveness.	3
 Almost EXCELLENT but...	"I wouldn't normally waste my time reviewing a film that has been reviewed so many times and had everything that can be said about it, said about it. However after reading through many of the reviews here it seems that not one person has mentioned the points I would like to make.First of all, this film really divides the audience primarily into two camps - those that can stomach the subject matter and those that cannot. Then within each of those camps you have those that thought the acting/script/production etc good and those that didn't. Some mention flaws in some scenes, such as Cage all too easily finding the girl's identity (big deal, in real life he either wouldn't have been able to find her at all - in which case the film would have ended there or it would have taken him months to years - in which case the film would have been a bit too long!) and guns not picked up from the correct side of the bed etc. (again, big deal, one could pick apart pretty much any thriller ever made if one really desires to). However, if one can stomach the subject matter and overlook these minor flaws, then what you have here is a sordid and gripping thriller (particularly the first half), apart from two MAJOR flaws.Both flaws are actually one and the same, although one happens half way through and one at the very end. I refer to the ridiculous and uneccessary explanations given for i) the motive of the film being requested (""because he can"") and ii) the motive of the killer (""because I like it""). First of all, these are such weak and shallow explanations but worse is the contrived and false way that the lines are delivered, almost as if they were added to the script last minute as an afterthought. Much better it would have been if either they were not given at all (leaving the audience to ponder ""why?""), or a more indepth, more honest and deeper explanation given.Aside from this, I think it's a well-made, atmospheric and gripping thriller, however the flaws I mention are extremely detrimental to the overall feel of the film, to the point of belittling itself and thus severely reducing it's impact... a real shame."	7
 Peep This Reviews	Nicholas Cage is very inconsistent and quirky as an actor. Joel Schumacher is extremely hit or miss when it comes to directors. So this is an experiment with the two that works very well as one of the darkest films from a major company I can think of. Fascinating story (although disowned by it's writer) that delves into the dark underbelly of society and disturbing curiosities. Great supporting cast too.	7
" Bondage, rape films and ""sick"" fetish just don't compare with this."	Spoiler The movie is great! Running through the movie, you pickup a regular story line like any normal arthouse film... but at the dramatic conclusion, it is possible to realise a message.Yes the film is a based on the grim reality of Snuff films, and that one was made for a rich man... but the movie had a whole new front to it, kept in the backround, and not exposed until the end.When a girl is killed on camera for fetish sexual enjoyment by a man who called himself machine and wheres a bondage mask with lots of knives, you would think the man had a very bad childhood, such as the main characters childhood on the movie: The cell, with Jennifer Lopez. But this is incorrect. This murderer had a mother who loved him and a father who he claims was in the normal genre. In machines life, nothing took an incorrect turn.At the end of the movie, he states this: I am what I am... daddy didnt rape me, mommy didnt hit me... I do what I do cos I like it.Killers and heartless people (some of them) are like that just because. Past events do not always take control what we do in life...	
 Watch and rate it yourself	"It's quite funny but I often judge films by the expectation I had before I watched it. So if I now have to judge 8mm prior to my expectations I have to say it's a pretty decent film. Everyone I asked about this film said ""uhh don't watch it it's sick.."" as well as reviews from allmovie.com etc. telling me to avoid watching it. I agree, the film is sort of sick somehow but I have seen worse in films people never complain about. I thought this movie would be more sexual than it is...in fact you ""only"" see an innocent girl get brutally killed and lots of ugly perverts in gimp suits. The scenes themselves are not that sickening only the story around it makes it pretty sick. Films like i.e. Pulp Fiction, which everyone seems to like apart of me are far worse or sickening than 8mm. Bad comparison but relates more to expectations of films. Any film made by Quentin Tarantino is more sickening than this one. Despite the fact that Tarantino is totally overrated anyway. However, not a great film but certainly not as bad as some people say it is. Pretty poor acting of Cage, horrible acting of Phoenix but some cool scenes such as the final scene where Cage chases that pervert at the end. Soundtrack is also rather poor.5.5 out of 10"	
 Starts well, but slithers into murkiness		
 Disturbing, thought provoking and somewhat touching		
 endearing movie, stupid cast	ok, first of all, does anyone else think that nicholas cages acting totally sucked? Playing a sincere family man, he has no emotion in his vioce, i think he should stick to all brawn and no brains action flicks, at least he might get better comments. The film is extremely moving, something that would have made it better, flashbacks into the life of the run-away girl, maybe how she got there and through the eyes of the girl how she was murdered, definatly would have made the film a tiny bit more interesting, not too much blood and gore.	
 Sick.	"This movie is absolutely sick. I could not believe that I actually paid money to buy this euro-trash. When I first read all the other negative comments on this page, I thought ""these people are morons"". But after I actually VIEWED the film, I changed my mind. This movie is very sick.Nicolas Cage plays a private investigator hired to find out if a 'snuff film' is authentic or not. (SPOILERS) Now, when he figures out everything, things get very stupid. In a way, it is somewhat similar to 15 MINUTES. But, since 8MM was made before 15 MINUTES, that isn't logical. But, when Cage finally discovers who is responsible for the killing depicted in the film, it all becomes very sick. And as if it wasn't bad enough with showing us how some people are so addicted to pornography, we get to see men on their knees telling of how they killed someone with no remorse. James Gandolfini may be a good actor, but he chose one sick-*ss part to play here. And after seeing this, I really do feel that Nicolas Cage must have some mental problems of his own. Because he is always playing a person with some sort of problem, EX. BRINGING OUT THE DEAD- he plays an ambulance driver on the brink of madness. Here, he plays a homicide detective on the brink of madness. To like a movie about killing that is this graphic, you must be a killer. 8MM is a movie that opens our eyes to the sick world that we live in. Let us thank it for that much, anyway. 8MM: 1/5."	
 WOW	I think any father with teenage girls should see this movie. It makes you wonder if this sort of thing has happened to the many children that come up missing every year. WOW this movie is powerful and makes you wonder how low can people get. Gage should get a nomination next year for his part in this movie. He was riveting.	8
 Great Film about Underside of Life!	I really enjoyed this movie.  I enjoyed the fact that this was not some kind of gloosied up Hollywoodized version of Andrew Kevin Walker's script, but it was a no-holds-barred reality that won't sit well with the squeamish.  This type of movie does not get made all the time, unfortunately, but it should. Not since Seven, written by Walker as well I might add, has a movie dealt with this much gruesomeness without glossing it over.I think this film deserves much more acclaim than it is getting.  I agree with most people in the fact that this movie is about acting and filmmaking. Joel Schumacher is a filmmaker, not just a director.  He has his own, fairly unique style.  I loved almost every movie Andrew Kevin Walker has done and this is no exception!	
 I've got a better ending!	Well, for the most part it was a good show. It was a little too violent and somewhat gory in places but it definitely kept me on the edge of my seat once it got going. I thought the acting and directing were very well done. The background music was terribly annoying. It didn't match most of the scenes and it was too loud when it should've been quiet. The ending was a little disappointing too. Oh well, maybe they'll do a sequel.	7
 Definitely not a date movie	I was in a really morbid mood after watching this movie.  I pity the fool who takes his girlfriend to see this.  With all the graphic, gritty scenes of bondage and bestiality, it was even a little hard for me to keep looking on.  But damn it, the script by Andrew Kevin Walker and direction by Joel Shumacher were just too good.  So I have to say it was good.  Great performance by Nicolas Cage.  Perhaps his best since Leaving Las Vegas.The message of this movie is clear: we don't know who owns or participates in a snuff film.  And you can bet that who ever does looks just as normal as the next person.	
 A MOVIE THAT SHOULD'VE STUCK TO THE SCRIPT	A great concept for this movie and for anyone who is a fan of screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker's other movie SE7EN it is a must see.  Unfortunately, I suspect that Director Joel Schumaker had a lot to do with the changes to the script.  It seems as though the Walker script was muted in parts that it didn't need to be and that certain aspects of the movie didn't ring true. Don't let this deter you however, there is a great deal of suspense generated where it should be and there is great acting and music.  Check this one out for sure.	8
 8 is good, but it's not 7.	"I'm guessing that people are going to see this as another main-stream Nicolas Cage action movie, it's not. This is another clever movie written by Andrew Kevin Walker (the same brilliant mind behind ""SE7EN"").  And like ""SE7EN"", it's very dark and morbid, yet you can't turn your head away. I highly enjoyed the first half of the movie, as Det. Welles (Cage) is investigating on who made the snuff 8 mm film, and if it's fake or not.  The investigating was intelligent and brilliantly staged similar to ""SE7EN."" However, by the final act, the film is slightly disappointing, as it becomes routine and cliched. Cage as usual is good as the detective who's trying to find answers, and this is director Joel Schumacher (a really nice guy in person!), better films.  I would put this on his 'good' shelf with ""A TIME TO KILL,"" ""THE CLIENT,"" and ""FALLING DOWN,"" and not on his bad shelf with ""BATMAN FOREVER,"" ""FLATLINERS,"" and ""BATMAN & ROBIN.""  It is a good movie, but it's still not as good as SE7EN.  **** out of *****."	7
 Disturbing but brilliant	"I recently saw 8MM and I didn't want to go out into the world after it. This was ten times more sadistic than Se7en, maybe on account of the violent pornography but maybe it was just because of the message. Se7en was about ""the world is an awful place but worth fighting for."" This had two interesting signals: ""Evil is a trap you cannot attempt to understand or flirt with"" and ""Those who are evil do it without motive, it's innate."" I heard this had to get cut just to get an R rating and it showed when Nicolas Cage was in porn shops and such,  because overall the movie was disturbing. It did delve into the ruining of the mind through this disgusting evil, which gave it some outstanding qualities. However, the kind of evil it explores is not for everyone, as it really runs into the heart of sin and the slums of humanity."	8
 huge disappointment	"i was more hyped to see this movie than any other in quite a while.  i love nicolas cage and i loved ""seven"".  this was a big ass disappointment.  i give it a 5/10.  average at best.  joaquin phoenix is a breath of fresh air though.  this boy could act and steals every scene he's in."	5
 My mind is still reeling...	A disturbing movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat is the only way I can think to describe 8mm.  Showing the evils and dangers of the hard-core pornographic industry may be a little too graphic for some viewers, but a wake-up call for others.  I thought the movie was well written, acted, and directed.  Though it would be hard to call this movie really enjoyable due to its subject, I feel that it was a quality film and I would have no problem recommending it to a mature viewer.	8
 very disappointing	In the hands of a more gutsy director, this had the makings of a very intriguing film. Unfortunately, Schumacher keeps us on the outside looking in, as opposed to really delving in to the specific porn culture that is at the center of the story. Sure, there are sleazy underground porn stores and seedy characters, but none of these things explain why Cage's character seems so affected by the events that transpire. The film also wraps up its main story in about 80 minutes, leaving us with anticlimactic rubbish for the last 40. I really wanted to like this film, but I couldn't get past the over-acting and sloppy storytelling. It's too bad. The trailer was great.	3
 Had Potential	"This movie had potential of being a great and excellent film. Unfortunately, the work of many men and women failed to accomplish this. I was never a real big fan of Nicolas Cage, but after I saw this movie, it made me see how little he can act. The music was totally wrong for this film. Also, the plot lacked. It should have been a lot deeper and meaningful, instead of an ego boost for Cage and Schumacher to see if they can win themselves Oscars. The story was basically predictable, with a few ""plot twists"" that made me think ""wow, another one of his many unneeded plot twists"". Overall, a great potential movie, with a good concept, that just needs Cage and Schumacher to stay away from re-writing scripts. I do have to say though, that I thought Joaquin Phoenix's (Max California) performance was excellent. He was the best part of the movie, and I lost interest soon after his role was done. Overall, cheesy acting throughout the cast, and poor directing on Schumacher's part.Adam Hornback Film Maker"	
 Good, if overlong		7
 Interesting, but lacking		
 Kinda Sorta	This movie was *eeehhhhhh* ok.  When Nic Cage was talking to Mrs. Christian he sounded like a ReRe in a suit, and he sounded like a robot wanting to remember his lines, but after he got through with her he got better into character.  and from then on the movie was good.  It wasn't as graphic as I thought it would be but I am glad, they were quite disturbing as they were. so when he finds the men who did 'it'  my chin was on the floor, I could have never guessed them myself, so that was good, the dark tone to the movie was also good, eg the slums of l.a....  I give this movie 7/10	
 Same-old same-old	It's all been done before, and much better, even by this screenwriter (Seven). There were so many moments when this film could have been good or, at least, more interesting. The one scene that gave some idea of the real Tom Welles hiding behind his family-man facade was when the petty thief asked him for a cigarette. That one scene is not worth the admission price, but if you have nothing better to do of an evening, this movie won't disappoint as a standard thriller.	
 To know and not to know.		
 Plumbing the Depths of Human Perversion		
 Can I get some Pace here?	Here I was ready to be blown out of the water by a thriller that could match up if not surpass SEVEN.  Well needless to say I was not even touched by a ripple of water.  The lack of chemistry between Nicolas Cage and Catherine Keener was enough to make the screening room chuckle during supposed intense scenes in this picture.  8mm just felt as if it never got going, every turn was as predictable as a dull Batman movie. I was able to enjoy a great performance from Joaquin Phoenix, maybe they should have cast him as the wife, hey it would have been more believable than Ms. Keener. In memory of Gene Siskel.  THUMBS DOWN!	
 A solid thriller with several ups and downs	"After the intriguing preview trailer captured me way back in January, I finally got to see Joel Schumacher's new thriller: ""8mm"".Nicolas Cage, a private investigator, is hired to discover the truth behind a ""snurff"" film -a piece of upsetting sexual perversion.The movie has its best moments when Cage and surprising Joaquin Phoenix, who stars as clerk of a LA porn shop, dive into the devil underground porn scene.Most of the thrills evolve out of the shocking perversity and aren't nearly as clever and unexpected as in Se7en. Some cuts and transitions are quite creative and the darkness of Se7en remains. But don't try to compare 8mm to the brilliance of Se7en or you'll be as disappointed as I was."	
 At least he wasn't butchering Batman again!		
 Middle Americans are to blame	The first two thirds of this film are pretty good, in spite of Nicholas Cage. Unfortunately the potential is lost with an ending tacked-on to appease Middle America. We could've seen the lead character getting dragged deeper into the world of snuff, and questioning his own desires. Instead we got the same old boring conventional action hero morality, the eye (or more) for an eye mentality, and the assertion that Cage is actually doing the world a favour by killing the bad guys.Did anyone ever stop to think that Machine's elderly mother might be just as upset at her sons death, as the mother of girl he is 'avenging'?And yet, if you stop watching before the final third, which is deeply unoriginal, there is fairly experimental and challenging stuff here. Not quite a study into psychosexual desire, but then this is a mainsteam film.	
 Schumacher headed in right direction	"When conversations turn to the topic of consistently bad directors, B-movie hacks like Larry Buchanan or Al Adamson easily come to mind. However, I have found Joel Schumacher's work steadfastly mediocre. He made his feature directorial debut with ""The Incredible Shrinking Woman"", an inane sham starring Lily Tomlin. A piece of junk called ""D.C. Cab"" followed. ""St. Elmo's Fire"", ""The Lost Boys"", ""Flatliners"", ""Falling Down"", and ""A Time to Kill"" are inferior mainstream Hollywood fare. Hell, he wounded the Batman franchise. Therefore, my expectations were meager for ""8MM"", which looked like a rehash of ""Hardcore"". So, I was surprised to encounter a modestly exciting story. Less an excursion into the world of pornography (or more exactly of bizarre fetish gratification), it is more of a noirish thriller. Cage's crisp, precise articulation recalls Bogart in ""The Big Sleep"". Joaquin Phoenix is no Bacall, but delivers an adequately subdued performance as Cage's escort. A capricious, foretelling ending and a liberal anti-smoking message are a couple of faults I had with the picture. With the praise afforded ""Tigerland"" and my reaction to this film, perhaps Schumacher may start producing some challenging work. 2.5 out of 4 stars."	
 Coming A Mile Away	I don't think I'm alone in saying that Nicholas Cage doesn't cut it as an action star. He has a gift for offbeat comedy, as evident in such films as RAISING ARIZONA and WILD AT HEART. Yes, BRINGING OUT THE DEAD did have its moments, but once again, that's because it was offbeat. He was lame in the virtually unwatchable SNAKE EYES, and he is just a shade better in 8mm.It seemed that the story in 8mm was going somewhere interesting at first. There was much dialogue about Cage's character being influenced by the evil around him. Then, just when Cage was about to step into the darkness the film makers pulled back and gave us just another Hollywood Action/Revenge flick. Yep, the same old thing. And if you watch as many films as I do, the same old thing just doesn't do it for you anymore.Kind of ironic, huh?	
 Cage cruises crazytown	"Very good drama with some excellent acting and photography showing life on the wild side. The film started off pretty slow but by the ending I was on the edge of my seat wondering if Cage would ever resolve his problem. Nerve wracking scenes that made me cringe thinking ""what if that was me dealing with those psychos?"", made for a very entertaining 2 hours. A definite must see."	7
 Has been better	"A better movie on this same subject was made with George C. Scott and was called ""Hardcore"".   If you liked 8mm (or even if you didn't), check that movie out.This is an OK thriller, but the director should stop pretending he's above the pornography he's depicting and admit that he made this movie simply to show shocking images of depravity.  This movie wallows in the more graphic segments and it becomes obvious that was the director's main interest in making this movie."	
 Already notorious Joel botch job	CONTAINS SPOILERSSometimes films that are off-kilter in their approach often throw up ideas and questions anyway, despite of themselves. This film is strange because I think the screenwriter possibly took his story from bits and pieces of other films rather than looking at real life, which I think is a comman problem in the industry as a whole. It's only long after seeing the film that I found it was by the seven guy which explains the similar production design which pushed the film further into splendidly risible self-parody. The whole bit with the girl being executed on film was a straight lift from 'Hardcore'. The scene at Machine's house at the end seemed taken from 'The Dead Zone'. The line 'because he could' has been used as many times as 'you're playing God' in the American cinema. The villains seem straight out of 'Scooby Doo'. The PI character with his squareness seems to come from much older films and is particularly jarring. The various 'can't get the gun/knife' etc seems an omnibus of film history itself. In keeping to genre conventions a film about exploitation inevitably becomes exploitative itself and this prevents American film from ever becoming art. Film makers always have one dubious eye on 'entertaining' the audience with lots of 'happenings' rather than focusing on 'ideas' or deep questions about the human condition which the average Hollywood producer is afraid of, perhaps holding to the perceived idea that the American public is allegedly anti-intellectual. Certainly a lot of reviews on this page allude to 'entertainment' as being a factor as to why they saw the film in the first place and were disappointed by it's slowness or were entertained in spite of it's slowness. The film's questioning of snuff as a myth suddenly becomes ironic as we are left to ponder whether the film itself can be trusted as it is a patchwork of so many film myths itself. The moral questions posed by the film quickly become irrelevant because the film's characters are doomed to follow genre conventions in solving problems in a way unrealistic to real life. Therefore the film unexpectedly becomes interesting because it becomes a critique of itself and cinema in general. For instance, is there any real 'reality' anymore if films are just about other films now? Can morality in the real world have any bearing in films like 8mm that are cut and pastes from other films which may, in themselves, have all manner of bogus moral perspectives, studio compromises and audience demographics in mind that make even less sense when amalgamated into one, which seems the case in this film? Certainly, taking a figure from the days of the Hayes code and planting him in modern LA makes for a curious cinematic experience.Having said that I don't think the film makers wanted to make an exploitative film. I think the moving and well judged scene in the kitchen where Cage asks the lonely mother whether she would want to know about her daughter's fate is authentically that of the real world and suggests the film maker's were sincere. However, once the film returns to 'the film world' we cease to believe in it. We are led to believe that an employee of a wealthy man would be both able and willing to walk into the porn underworld, a world presumably light years away from his own experience, ask for a snuff movie (which brought a fierce backlash when the tougher PI asked for it) and then somehow 'find' the right people to make a real snuff movie when the more likely reponse would be porn merchants calling the police long before he asked the 'right' people. We are then led to believe he and they would be party to something that would bring them the death sentence for something which did not involve a huge amount of money. It is also hugely unlikely that the PI would ring the girl's mother in order to get permission to commit homicide. It is just beyond credibility. Also the very public death of Machine would almost certainly cause the PI to be linked to his other act of murder, especially as the dead bodies of the two other protagonists in the warehouse would be found. But as we are in 'filmland', consequences are not part of the plot therefore once again rendering any interesting moral questions superfluous. The final letter becomes a disclaimer tacked on by the film maker's which is ultimately meaningless, despite a potentially interesting question about breaking the law to prevent an even greater evil.Although the film does not work it is fascinating for an entirely different set of reasons thrown up ironically BECAUSE it is sincere. It makes you question the nature of reality and the nature and process of modern film making today. There is no audience for this film. Funnily, it seems the producers made it for no deeper a motive than the wealthy man who wanted to see a snuff movie. He had the money and because of that he did it because he could.	
 Good... but wait for it to come out on video.		
 money buys anything	There are already over 300 comments as I post this: clearly the subjects of violent sex and snuff generate a great deal of arousal and fear (arousal). Considering this, and the fact that illegal, volatile, morally reprehensible material can be procured easily by anyone (try surfing over to even a mildly obscure newsgroup), who would doubt that snuff actually exists?	
 Peek Performance		
 This movie stunk		
 get a plot people saw a thousand times and just add sex or violence or both.		
 Dont get your hopes up.		
 Wretched	"If you see lots of movies, you will probably not find this to be shocking or ""sick"". You will find it to be boring. Its slick, but hollow. The victim is dead at film's start, so the viewer has no emotional investment in the case--other than your basic good vs. evil thing. So we are left with a sleuth movie devoid of plot twists (or much plot) or cleverness. The movie is too lazy to give us a couple of other suspects who turn out to be sleazy, sure enough, but innocent. Of course, the bad guys are very bad (and wear black and leather a lot) and the good guy is very good. (How about a little nuancing like in ""Tightrope"" where Clint Eastwood gets a little revved  at the seedy things going on around him) Style and dark titilation are left to satisfy the viewer, but they are not close to enough. Stunningly bad."	
 In a class of its own	8MM is NOT for the faint hearted.  In a sugary coated world this movie dives deep in to the sick lives of pornography and of those who profit and those who die.Despite the dark plot and theme of the movie, it is well acted and well written.  Not only causing you to flinch but feel sick at the prospect of being apart of such an industry, if one can call it that.8MM gets into your head and I found it hard to shake the images out.Nicholas Cage was excellent.  As his knowledge of the impact of the situation grew he was able to put into his character, making you believe the trauma of what he is going through.This movie is not something you put on for a relaxing night at home.  You have to be prepared for the effects of this movie and how it makes you look at another aspect of human nature and how we are out to profit even if it means death.	
 Makes you feel uneasy	I guess feeling uneasy while watching this film is quite understandable when you know that the writer to the 8MM script, Kevin Andrew Walker, is the man who wrote the script to the very disturbing Se7en. In 8MM there is an uneasiness that you forget about as soon as you've turned off the video, the experience of watching Se7en stayed with me for weeks. 8MM is a good film, I liked it even though there are some parts of the film that are too unbelievable and too clichéd to be really appreciated, and the last half hour does not live up to the expectations I had. Nicolas Cage is good, as is Joaquin Phoenix. Peter Stormare's portrayal of loathsome Velvet was a bit over the top, even though director Joel Schumacher might be blamed for that.[Possible spoiler follows.] Overall, a good film that sadly loses its power in the last half hour.	6
 Different....		
 Don't expect too much out of this one!	"Despite the fact that this film was written by the same person who wrote Seven, despite the fact that Nicholas Cage starred here, this film is simply mediocre.At first, it is very interesting. But it loses steam in the second half; it becomes quite predictable. This movie follows the footsteps of ""Seven"" by trying to shock you as much as possible. Nicholas Cage, in his investigation, goes down to the most depraved areas of the sex industry. It seems this movie was written just to scare people. To make them sick. The rest was completely forgotten."	
 You must be willing to tackle the issues to appreciate this film		
 Lost Boy		
 Puke	Some of the worst acting I've seen in awhile.  Cage's reactions of horror, Machine's acting etc. etc. - I thought the acting just plain stunk.  Cage can act - we've seen that in Face Off, The Rock etc.  The subject matter was bizarre, but I don't see why that would affect the acting.  Don't waste your $.	5
 Some Doors, Shouldn't be open.. But you have to peek in!	"This movie was Amazing! At first I was doubtful of how good it would be but I sat down to watch it because of Nick Cage and Joaquin Phoenix. It sort of just sucked me in.. Other things faded out and I felt I was in the movie desperately searching for the answers Nicholas Cage was searching for. Joaquin Phoenix's ""Max California"" added for a sarcastic comic relief to such a serious and creepy plot. This movie is scary! Not for your normal reasons (say a huge monster or spirit chasing a main character) but for the fact that this movie could be Non-Fiction and knowing things like this happen everyday in the porno underground. This movie really makes you think.. With out making you bored."	
 Engaging story mixes thrills with controversial subject		
 tiresome		
 I should have listened to Public Enemy	"After sitting through ""8mm"", my initial thoughts veered toward a song title recorded by the pioneers of political rap, Public Enemy. While this film was supposedly ""Welcome to the Terrordome"", I had more of a ""Don't Believe the Hype"" feeling. Then again, that would be one of the few emotions derived from this formulaic death march, a movie with all off the subtlety of  a Carrot Top film. I heard all the buzz about this movie before its release: how ""gruesome"" and ""disturbing"" this film is; how the test audience's reactions were so extremely polar; how it was so much like ""Se7en"". Don't Believe the Hype! This movie might be ""disturbing"" to people who live in a steel-hard shell and don't understand why people would volunteer to be handcuffed or tied-up and whipped. I wonder how anyone could be shocked by anything in this film, since the plodding, predictable script takes 90 minutes to reach the first (and only) real plot twist. By this point, you know exactly what is going to happen in the final 40 minutes, and the plot twist just doesn't wind up mattering that much. I know the MPAA overlords forced cuts of this movie, but I can't see how any additional footage would save this turkey."	
 Personally, the film is well directed and believable; the plot unfoils dramatically with the correct imagery and dialogue. After viewing, you will have second thoughts of what your neighbors do on their spa		
 Joel Schumacher is redeemed!	Now this is brilliant. A dark movie that delves into the evil of mens souls and the gut wrenching horror of a seedy, disgusting underworld that exists right under your very nose. This film was not well received at all, mostly due to the fact that Shumacher does such a great job at taking us right along with Nick Cage into the deep, rancorous pits of hell. Never in the history of film has a film been so dark, so moody and so terrifying just over the details of one single murder. Many have compared this to Seven, but what Seven does with six grisly, very graphic murders, 8MM does with just one you never see. This film also attacks American cinema at its very roots. Most plots now a days run in formulaic fashion: Bad guys kill/maim/harm the loved ones/property/way of life of our hero, the hero loses something, then gets back who S/he is by finding said bad guys and killing them. The concept of vigilantism is rampant in most of todays movies and America has been desensitized to it, this movie is a wake up call. See this, but not on a date. You just won't get any.	
 I'm in doubt.	I'm in doubt. I don't know what to think of this film. On one hand it is a good thriller (or maybe a horror film), on the other hand it is really sick! I'm not sure if we really want to to see al this explicit violence. For what is the meaning?I do admit that for some reason I never reacted so strongly to a film. And I've seen violent films before. So there must be something with it that does something to me. Maybe that is just the director's intention.	
 What is not on the screen.	A lot of fuss has been made about the explicitness of some scenes on 8mm. Well, there are really some explicit scenes, but the major shocking elements are the ones that you don't see: almost all violent action happens away from the eyes of the audience, on films seen by the characters. All the audience sees is the reaction of that other audience, what opens space for inference, and what we infer about it is much worse than any explicit violence we see in movies everyday. A film for those with the guts to let imagination go free!	
 It Ain't no pleasantville...	"When i've heard about 8mm i knew what i was going into. Critics in the newspaper said it was a dark film dealing with dark characters. 8mm is sure dark, but in the right side of the word. The movie takes you into the lowest dumps of new-york and cali, as well as to the castles of high society, to meet with all kinds of characters, and see a whole new world, that exists right under our noses. Tom Wells, played by Cage is asked by a late millionaires' wife to find if a snuff film found in her husband's safe is real or a fake. Tom takes the job very seriously and goes out there to find the sources of this horror film. To my opinion, Tom is encouraged first by the money he is about the earn from this job, but as deeper he goes, he is kind of appealed by this strange new world he discovers. He wants to uncover why these people doing it, and as Mr.Kalifornia (Tom's little helper) said, ""But you are not Either disgusted of what you seen, right?"". I found this film interesting especially because i know it really exists. It is not fiction, and not a sicki thoughts of the writer. It is out there, and maybe it is preferable not to know about it at all, after all, the world is ain't no pleasantville..."	
 Overhyped on the violence angle, works best as a murder/thriller story	This is really the kind of film you would only go to see once.  Although what you've probably heard most about it is the violence, this really acts as a driving force behind the main story, which is essentially Nicolas Cage's character seeking to find the truth behind a so-called 'snuff movie'. During this investigation, he comes face to face with the very worst side of sleeze, and the sex industry in America.  I think it portrays very well the reactions and emotions of a 'normal' guy, ( Cage plays a family man, and often portrayed in the movie talking to his wife and baby daughter ) when faced with this kind of violence. Cage does pull this off very well, and the acting is always good, if a little 'over-cooked' in parts.   The comparisons with the film '7' I think are misplaced, I never felt the same sense of shock or fear in '8MM', and the motivations and forces which drive the characters are entirely different.The one failing I found was the final scene, which I thought was hammily acted and entirely predictable.   If you go see this movie, don't bring you Mom, but don't expect to see something you never have before either.I'd give a 6/10.	
 Daring, gruesome look into the underground porn scene. Heavy, but intense.		
 starts so good	I loved this movie for quite a while . It started very well and looked like being great thriller . It did remind me of seven a little bit , but i really enjoyed the darkness and seediness the movie was descending into . But.....it was like someone else took over the direction half way through with unbelievable ridiculous villains and fight scenes.The masked bad guy was almost as bad as the cretin in the last batman movie .for me the whole thing deteriorated into a farce from what started out as a thoroughly watchable movie into a pile of crapthere was a similar movie some years back called Hard Core with George c Scott .This was done far better and didn't finish up like an episode of World Championship Wrestling	
 Rambled and scrambled a worthy message.	"I was not very impressed with 8mm. The script was not very tight and tended to ramble. I was never drawn in, I never cared about any of the characters and wasn't shocked or scared at any time.The dark scenery was good though, someone had done their homework on seedy establishments of which there were many.I think the only 'point' that the film made was that porno'/sick/violent images, ""get in your head and stay there"". They do effect you, they do change you and the change, however small, is never for the good. This is a point well worth making but could have been made better than this film manages."	6
 Angst and stereotypes spoil a potential hit	This is a film that explores a very dark and seemy underside of life. Thus said it seems a pity that the people involved in this  underworld seem almost as if out of a gothic movie. This two-dimensional stereotyping detracts from the plot and gives Schumacher the chance to exercise his action credentials.I wish that the film had continued its opening character development rather than almost snap into the action. It was a shame that the role wife and child of Wells was diminished throughout the bulk of the film. Cage gurns his way with shock and angst throughout the picture and by the end you really rather he would adopt another expression.Despite this, the film does deal with disturbing issues and does not glamorise it at all which is to its credit. The way that the hero can only cross the line by asking permission is a masterful piece of cinema and well worth viewing just for that. The film is shocking and horrific in places and viewers should be aware but the villains are too 'comic book' in character which counteracts this horror.	
 8MM, the guage of film and guns.		
 See it !	8mm is the kind of movie that cinema screens are made for . Excellent action, sort of documentary in a way,this film shows how the underworld operates. Very good action, people at the edge of their seats.	
 Disappointing trawl through a twilight world of pornography and murderers.		
" Go see Alejandro Ameabar's ""Tesis"" instead"	"This topic has been touched before and in a BETTER fashion: Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar's movie named ""Tesis"" This 8mm movie is too Hollywood-cared so it won't give you the details of what would take to make a snuff movie. It's kinda cool but I was expecting something more bizarre, violent and depressing like Seven, but hey, you can't win them all, do you?"

 My thoughts on 8mm		
 00summary		
 **1/2out of ****	While it was fun to see how the hero, played very well by Nicholas Cage, would solve the case, the movie felt like a very R-rated episode of Murder, She Wrote.  The way the movie played out would not happen in real life; all the clues were conveniently found only by the hero, and only when it would help propel the story.  Cage would find a clue, which would lead him to another clue, and so on, and so on.  In fact, now that I think about it, it seemed not just like an episode of Murder, She Wrote, but also like a RPG video game.  Everything was too neat and perfect, and it all tied together way to easily.  However, while I make it sound above like I hated the movie, this is far from the truth.  It was very entertaining, and I enjoyed following the clues right along with Cage's character.  I had a good time watching the film.  It just appeared to me that the script was kind of lazy, and it had potential to be much more than it was.	
" Falling short of possible excellence in ""8mm"""		
 It took 3 hours of watching Cartoon Network to cheer me up	8mm Stars Nicolas Cage as a detective who is hired by a Millionaire's wife to verify the authenticity of a snuff film she finds after his death. It was an okay movie. It reminds you that there is evil in this world and that the people who perpetrate the evil look like normal average people on the outside but inside they are sick monsters. After the movie I felt really creepy. It took 3 hours of watching Cartoon Network to cheer me up :)Rating:6	6
 I was stunned	I have just come back from the theather. This movie has left me wondering not about the script nor about Nicholas Cage excelent acting but instead about the question of the exploration of porn movies. It is indeed heavy so don't expect to take someone fragile to watch this movie: it is strong, but achieves the best a movie ever may do: make you think and wonder about life.Four stars out of five.	
" ""Be Careful Little Eyes What You See"""	"Know what the movie is about before you see it. I went to see it because I like action-packed Nicolas Cage movies, but didn't investigate the pornographic context of the movie. Joaquin Phoenix (Max California)delivers a good warning to Nicolas Cage (Tom Welles), ""If you dance with the devil, the devil don't change...The devil changes you!"" And also reminds him that you can't erase images you've seen with your eyes. Which made me remember a little song I learned as a child in Sunday school: Be Careful Little Eyes What You See. In regards to seeing a movie such as this, my question is the same one that Tom Welles asks Max California: ""Why would anyone want to watch it?"""	
 Finally, a movie worth the price of admission	"I have no idea why people don't like this movie.  Perhaps they are buying into the negative feedback, typical lemming behavior.  Judge this film for yourself, see how good it is.  It IS good. This was the first film I have seen in 6 months that was actually worth paying to see.  Why would people go see this if they wanted to see ""Seven?""  NEWSFLASH:  This movie has NOTHING to do with ""Seven.""  Get that out of your system.  This film is not nearly as disturbing as people say, in fact, it is pretty tame compared to horror flicks.  This is a psychological thriller, not an in-your-face action/drama. Filmed by an excellent director (forget the Batman movies he did), 8MM is one of the best movies of 1999."	10
" ""Lurid, Intense, and Original"""		
 Don't waste your time and money.	"I saw this movie expecting twisted tale, similar to ""7"". What I got was a boring, insipid movie, and a waste of $8.50. Cage was miserably miscast; I almost cried with boredom when he attempted to portray a mentally broken man. Cage's character constantly contradicts himself. The end result is a movie which isn't entertaining, doesn't have a hint of a point about society, and does nothing except leave the audience disturbed. This movie is strike two for Cage. Maybe he should get back together with Connery and John Woo."	
 Good Slimy characters	"Eddie Poole, Max California, Dino Velvet, Machine: there are not many movies with so many slimy characters so over-the-top. James Gandolfini's Eddie Poole is some mean puddle of sleaze, and he's just one of the boys. I recommend 8MM for everyone who feels that the characters in  ""True Romance"" are simply Shakespearian; and Christopher Walken fans everywhere."	7
 Definitely NFE: It's beyond squeamish -- gutsy subjects, seriously horrid extreme. Strictly mature audience.		7
 A gripping and disturbing film with tremendous performances by all	This movie was perhaps the most disturbing film I have ever seen. I was actually reduced to tears from being in the theater alone. Nic Cage and company portrayed each character with such realism that I was in the underground porn world myself for two hours and I was terrified. It was a fabulous movie, but be warned if you choose to see it! You'll leave desperately needing humor to sleep well that night!	
 A New Side of Nicolas Cage	"This is the darkest movie I have seen Nicolas Cage in.  I saw a whole new side of Cage's talents.  I really could feel the anguish he felt in his portrayal of Tom Welles, as he watched some very graphic and violent ""snuff"" movies.  And at the end, as he seeks revenge, I could feel his rampaging emotions...anger, disgust, despair.  Cage was excellent.  It's been a long time that I have felt fear while watching a movie, and this one really scared me.  It frightened me, disgusted me, and made me squirm in my seat. Despite the mood of the film, and some of the more violent scenes, I liked it.  Nicolas Cage really carried this film over the top.  8mm is just another example of his extraordinary talent in acting.  I would not recommend this film for the weak-hearted, but for those who can stand extremely violent/graphic scenes, I would whole-heartedly recommend it...at least just to watch Cage's brilliant performance."	
 If you swim in a sewer, you'll come up stinking.	"Nic Cage is a great actor. No doubts there. That's why I rented this movie. But the horrors of hell that it drags you through is next only to your worst nightmare.  I'm sure they wanted to bring out a point. I.e. ""Evil is bad and some of it is really really really bad...beware!"". But why fall into the muck yourself? Ugh!!! Like the verse says, ""Can a man take fire into his bosom and not be burned?"" Not healthy. Sorry."	1
 Heap of waste	Yes, I have seen this piece of ... Andrew Kevin Walker writing. Why? For perverted delight to laugh for other people's criminally bad taste and work, I guess. A baboon could write better characters, plot and dialog than Andrew Kevin Walker. A private detective traces snuff films in the porn industry, and the filth and sleaze ooze from the every corner. Well, porn industry is undoubtedly a sewer, not some pretty-love-making-under-the-bedclothes-fantasy of the soap operas, and Andrew does not shrink under the challenge to show it. Anywho, our hero kills the human filth behind the snuff films (hello, what did you expect!) and when the cleansing is over, the film ends. The hero is apparently lost his soul, but I watched this from TV, so I saved my money, yai! Someone wrote that this is not a proper film to the teenagers, but actually, this is a PERFECT film to the teenagers, and everybody who is young at heart: there's porn and snuff films and everything is sooo gritty (read: sleazy).	1
 Dim-bulb film-making...	"Joel Schumacher is perfectly capable of making a slambang thriller, even if his courses of action don't always jibe with audience expectations, however his more serious efforts can be completely off the mark. Here, his intention to make a gritty, no-holds-barred film about the porno underworld is laced with tedious TV crime-drama set-ups and clichés aplenty! Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay should bear at least half the blame, but the sinking feeling one gets from ""8MM"" relates largely to way it looks and plays out. Nicolas Cage is wasted in role as investigator trying to determine if a bloody snuff flick is real, and, if not, what happened to the young female victim involved. Intentionally seamy, but unintentionally stupid. Worth-watching if only for a terrific supporting performance by Joaquin Phoenix as a clerk, but poor Catherine Keener has an insulting role as Cage's wife. *1/2 from ****"	4
 Shocking - but not even in an interesting sort of a way.	An awful film to endure, let alone recommend to anyone else. Nicholas Cage, playing his usual sullen character is complimented by Peter Stormare who can only be described as ridiculous (if slightly funny), and a woefully sleazy disgusting scumbag in the form of Soprano's over - rated James Gandolfini. His turn from pleading wimp to aggressor by suddenly challenging Cage when he is in a precarious position is ludicrous. Has been mentioned in the same breath as Se7en, but isn't even in the same league. The scene where Cage tries to do right by the victims mother, but instead reduces her into a frenzy of anguish is actually horrible to watch. Some films are disturbing, but in an engrossing sort of a way, such as the great Se7en, Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon, but this is simply disturbing, period. It does not have the twists of Se7en, nor the characters or plot development of The Lecter films, and always seems like a poor attempt at a psycological thriller. You are left with an abhorance to the film at the end, rather than that itching curiosity to view it again, that comes with the countless other films of this type which are are significantly better than this.	
 Yet again, Cage's big name attracts viewers to an empty, shallow movie	Don't waste your time. If Cage's lack of acting skills in other flicks hasn't completely turned you off to him, they will in this one. This movie is the ultimate voyeuristic exploitation. The underworld of the violent-sex-film industry is the film's main selling point, and it comes off as completely gratuitous -- witness Cage's predictable stock reactions when he watches the death-porn flick in the dark theater. This gets a one out of ten.	1
 A complete unbelievable story	This is a piece of crap. First of all, did the producers and the writers ever stopped to ask if such events ever existed. The storyline was boring and the camera took the viewers to practically all the slumps in the United States. The story also puts a biased negative views on people with special interest specifically it portrays the S&M group as a bunch of sadistic killers going around cutting people up for a movie in pretty much the same fashion as how gays and lesbians are portrayed as less than human by some parties. Has there been any high profile FBI cases that depicts a wealthy millionaire contracting sick killers to cut up someone in real life ? Is this a frequent criminal occurrence where people frequently get chopped up for some private films ? Because the film seemed to have portrayed that there is a whole industry specialized in kidnapping and cutting up people for short movies. This is completely inaccurate and the studios should feel ashamed for misleading, bias discrimination of specific groups of people and should be taken off the shelves.	1
 Wretched manipulative film	With 8mm, it feels like Joel Schumacher is trying to emulate Se7en. Both were written by Andrew Kevin Walker. But Joel falls short in this unpleasant, clichéd film. With Se7en, you were swept along with the characters. In 8mm, you can feel the hand of the director pushing you were he wants you to go.               8mm is blatant in it's attempts to manipulate the viewer, but is so clumsy you end up resenting it and the director for doing so. A film like this needs to be more subtle in it's attempts to coax the desired response from the audience.	1
 Bat nipples messes up another one.	Joel Schumacher (Bat Nipples, for his rendition of the bat suit, that was disturbing but not this film), took an excellent story from Andrew Walker, then got scared of the concept and toned it down to a watery shell of what could have been. The theme is a dark one but Schumacher is too scared of it to show us a good representation of this culture. The only shining moment is Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Max California, it was great. But not good enough to save this film.	1
 What was the point...	This movie sucked from beginning to end! The story line was boring and all the male characters were worthless. It was completely predictable and not the least bit thrilling or exciting. Anyone looking for a quality movie should look elsewhere...you will not find it here. The entire thing was 2 hours of wasted time that I will never get back.	1
 8mm is poor remake	"8 MM is a remake of the Spanish film ""Thesis"" directed by Alejandro Amenavar. This remake includes more explicit violence, which is exactly what the story (in particular the original script) points at. Although the actors, say Nicolas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix, are good at their roles, 8MM does not preserve the philosophy and the most interesting question of the original film, which is, I think: why human nature morbidly enjoys seeing and knowing of the suffering of others, including the present audience which is enjoying the film. I give this film 3/10 because it is not only a remake, but also one that does not honor the original script."	3
 I couldn't believe the ending	Of all people, George Castanza was the killer. I should have seen it coming. I knew it! From the beginning when I saw a girl get raped by a flabby man I knew it could be none other than the star of Seinfeld. My Venezuelan heart has been torn into pieces. After I saw the movie I went to my pillow and cried. I had to take work off the next morning I was so upset. Luckily this film is fit for all ages, so you can rent it for the kids. Just cover their eyes during raping and violence scenes. Also watch out for the swearing. Other than that they'll love it. After I took work off I called my mom. Also, the beginning felt vaguely familiar. I could swear that I've met an old lady whose husband died recently and she opened up a secret vault and found a video of a girl getting raped. That leads me to a question. What silly old man would have a video of his granddaughter or something getting raped? It's a good thinking question. It's like as philosophical as Plan Nine from Outer Space. It really makes ya think.	1
 Yuck!	I wasnt expecting what the movie was at all. I wasnt pleased, i was disgusted by the movie and all the contents and wanted to puke! i can usually handle a good scare, but this movie wasnt scary, it was grotesque and nasty. how could nick cage wanna make this movie in the first place? how could somebody actually sit down in the theater and bear to watch that movie? i only could handle 10 minutes and that was the beginning credits and the first 2 minutes and that was all i could handle. (F F-)	1
 Indescribably Awful!	The absolute worst movie I have ever seen (next to Patch Adams and Forrest Gump)!  The story could have been told in a less graphic and gruesome manner without having to lose its edge.  This is a new low in American cinema!  To even think that this film made over $40 million at the box office leads you to wonder if alot of the population is deeply disturbed.  I watched about 45 minutes, shut it off, watched the other half the next day, and then took a long shower afterwards.  I FELT dirty after watching this!  Avoid at all costs!  No, strike that, go out and buy it, then burn it!0/10	1
 innocence shattered	Don't see this movie, especially if you're a girl.  Neither I nor my companions had any idea what it was about, and it turned out to be the most disturbing movie I've ever seen in my life. A woman I talked to afterwards said she cried the whole way through it.  I, myself, left the theater shaking.  This was a horrifying, unnerving movie. It unveiled a world I've always tried to believe did not exist. I've always been too involved with behind-the-scenes stuff to be affected by movies, but this movie scarred me.  I wish I had not seen it and I don't think there's any reason anyone SHOULD see it.  If anything, it will only promote the industry it (hopefully) was intended to bemoan. If you do go, please read up on it enough beforehand to know exactly what you're getting yourself into.	1
 8mm, Makes Battlefield Earth look like Emipire Strikes Back		1
" An attempt to explore the taboo subject of ""snuff"" movies. crippled by the wrong director and wrong supporting actors for the job."	"The concept of ""snuff"" movies (e.g. a film in which people are killed for real on camera for the entertainment of others) has been a bit of a taboo subject in mainstream Hollywood movies. ""8mm"" attempts to deal with the subject matter head-on, but rather like another taboo-busting thriller from a couple of decades earlier - Cruising (1980) - the film fails to capitalise on its potentially eye-opening themes. The real downfall with ""8mm"" is that the wrong director has been given the job of pulling it all together. Joel Schumacher is more noted for his neon-lit comic-book technique, and his MTV-style editing, but this sort of dark and seedy story is not really his forte. ""8mm"" cries out for a director like David Fincher  someone who can stamp a degree of dark, depraved authority over the proceedings.Private eye Tom Welles (Nicholas Cage) makes money by catching cheating husbands and wives. With this money, he supports his wife Amy (Catherine Keener) and their baby. However, Tom is dragged into a rather darker mystery when he is hired by a wealthy widow, Mrs. Christian (Myra Carter), to investigate the affairs of her recently deceased husband. It seems that among the late Mr. Christian's belongings was a gratuitous 8mm reel of pornographic film, showing the sexual abuse and slaying of a young girl. Mrs Christian desperately wants to know if the film is genuine ""snuff"", or if the killing was realistically faked. Tom eventually finds the victim's mother (Amy Morton), and follows further clues into the sleazy pornographic underworld of Los Angeles. Here, a sex-shop worker named Max (Joaquin Phoenix) helps the bewildered detective find his way around the disturbing and seedy underbelly of the sex culture. Tom gradually homes in on pornographers Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini) and Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare), and their hulking sidekick The Machine (Chris Bauer). It seems that this odious trio hold the nauseating answers as to what really happened in the 8mm reel of snuff film discovered at the start of the movie. As Tom draws closer to the truth, he finds his morality in question and his life in danger.Cage gives one of his more restrained performances, and is especially believable in a scene where he watches the original 8mm snuff film and is physically repulsed at what he sees. Phoenix is also very good  indeed, quite the best thing about the film  as the sex-shop employee who introduces Tom to a sexualised culture that he can barely understand. Alas, the performances of Gandolfini and Stormare are over-the-top almost to pantomime-like levels, and really wreck the plausibility of the film's second half. The film is also extremely overlong, and many viewers will find themselves clock-watching well before the climax. Certain scenes are rather nasty, but there isn't a moment in the film that is truly as ground-breaking or daring as Schumacher thinks it is. In fact, one can almost sense that the director is far too easily pleased with himself for tackling a hitherto taboo topic. ""8mm"" has its moments for sure, but on the whole is an under-achieving thriller that can be all-but forgotten a few weeks after seeing it."	5
 8MM my eye	The 8MM film reel appears to be twice the width of an actual 8MM reel. The projected movies show a degree of grain that is much more consistent with 16MM film. It is distracting to the point of being goofy for the title of this film to be so obviously wrong.I did not buy the motivations for many of the central characters. For instance, the elderly widow seemed to not even know her deceased husband's nature after countless years of marriage. She acted as though she had lived a very sheltered innocent life free of real world dealings, yet had no trouble sleuthing out her husbands hidden financial transactions. She disdained cash, yet had not trouble coming up with something like $2 million hard cold one in a very short period of time. She relentlessly pressed on in a cause that could yield nothing good for herself or anyone else. After her death, her man servant did not seem the least bit concerned that he along with all his fellow workers were suddenly unemployed.Many of the other characters behaved in equally hollow plot driven ways. Count me unimpressed.	4
 Snuff's enough		3
 A Big Downer (Minor Spoilers)	"The widowed wife of a powerful industrialist finds a snuff film amongst his most private possessions. Is it real or fake? Fearing publicity, she hires a private detective to uncover the source of the film. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker, author of ""Se7en"", directed by Joel Schumacher, and starring Nicholas Cage, ""8MM"" has all the hallmarks of being a truly creepy, disturbing (and good) film. Unfortunately, it doesn't take Schumacher and Walker long to loose their way.  Cage's character, Tom Welles, doesn't behave as 99.99% of the world's population would, given the same set of circumstances. Instead of just following leads, he also immerses himself in the grotesque world of extreme pornography. Then, as it becomes increasingly apparent that the film is real (i.e., a murder was committed), he doesn't go to the cops, he starts winging it and taking greater risks, both for himself and his friends and family. Finally, when confronted with the murderers he assumes the role of avenging angel. C'mon, give me a break. The unreality of the characters coupled with the unrelentingly depressing appearance of the movie make this movie.a big downer. I'd give it a pass."	4
 Why?		2
 Unsuccessfully attempts to deal with complex issues		4
 I don't see what the big deal is.	This movie isn't as gruesome as popular critics let on.  Sure there is bondage, latex, some brutality, but it isn't really that intense, especially compared to Silence of the Lambs, or Seven, or an MTV video (late night). The movie tries to disturb by taking normal average people and having horrible things happen, but either I am callous, or this movies fails.The only good thing about this movie is the performance by Joaquin Phoenix of Max California.  Everything else is take it or leave it.	4
 Haunting	After I finished watching 8mm with some friends, one said it's the most disturbing movie he's ever seen. Yes it's violent, but the underlying themes are quite equally disturbing, and the depravity is on display in some of the characters.I can only imagine what the on-set atmosphere was like, but maybe there were some light moments on set. The story is gripping, and you can only imagine the turmoil private detective Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) who later played an airline pilot in Left Behind in 2014. If the Academy voters had balls, they would have nominated 8mm for Best Picture, and given a nod to Nicolas Cage for his excellent performance in a haunting and harrowing role.	9
 Very well made thriller, not for the faint of heart		7
 A Masterful Film!		10
 actual movie	I saw this movie while watching TV late at night. I decided to watch the news for only 5 minutes but this movie is one that must bee seen, it catches your attention from the beginning until the end. Nicolas Cage succeeds in portraying the private detective. His search for truth is very believable. The film asks a very big question: what about the difference between moral views and practical life? What about justice? Questions worth thinking. The actuality of the film is great, we all speak about the Natalee Halloway case, and Joram still walking freely. Does this film offer a solution? But the film also has enough fun factors, the search of Cage is worth watching. An interesting movie!	10
 The seedy stuff was great - the family stuff - not so much		6
 If you dance with the devil, the devil don't change. The devil changes you.		7
 Dark Movie, Good Twists, Turns Your Stomach	This was a very good movie which reveals a side of this world that most people rarely see. It's gut wrenching plot line really plays to your inner emotions and you find yourself beaming angry at the antagonist. The movie is well written and moves at a good pace and all's well that ends well. The main character played by Nicolas Cage undergoes a major paradigm shift as the movie develops. He is thrown into this underworld and he finds himself fighting his own demons and trying to stay true to his values and fundamentals. I throughly enjoyed all the characters in the movie, and the plot line keeps you thinking ahead. Overall it was a good watch.	7
 Disturbing Piece of Film	Nicolas Cage sincerely shows his talents in this disturbing actioner surrounding the insidious world of snuff flicks.While the subject matter is quite disturbing, the atmosphere is adequately generated here by virtue of a good score and a brilliant Cage performance. Though the subject matter is sleazy, the story itself is quite compelling, delivering action, intrigue, and a congruent stream of ideas.I found this one darkly entertaining, if also darkly disturbing in places I didn't wish to be disturbed. Not many can do that.It rates a 7.4/10 from...the Fiend :.	7
 Not exactly a spoiler...but...	"I am not one to typically leave comments about films although I am an avid film buff. I felt compelled to write a quick comment on this film for the simple fact that many people I believe miss ""the message"" of the film which to me was a most important one. Like movies, such as ""American History X"", this movie contained a very powerful message, which if looked upon with prejudice because of something else one simply did not like about the movie, could be sorely missed. I felt that the ultimate message of the movie, other than itself introducing the audience to the world of ""snuff and underworld pornography"", was that sadistic rapists, murderers and other perpetrators as such can really be anyone one thinks they know...that be a neighbor, a co-worker, a mutual friend....anybody that seems normal on the surface but is actually anything but what one thinks of them. Put simply, one can never judge a book by its cover - a killer or rapist could be anyone. As with this movie, if you think it is just a movie about snuff pornography or another blockbuster with Nicholas Cage, look closer there are more important messages in movies than just what they are about. As with American History X, most people believe it to be just a movie about a race war,,,white supremacy vs. color yet if one really admires the movie they see it as a movie about ""HATRED"", that hatred is baggage and if one carries it too long it just may destroy them!"	9
 Uncompromising and tense drama from Joel Schumacher		
 one of my favorites	i hate the fact that people will rate this movie badly because they didn't' want to stomache the contents of it. I've disliked every role Cage has played except for raising arizona, but he couldn't' ruin this movie for me. there's not much that will make me uncomfortable but the final Cage/Gandolfini scene messes me up every time. A brutal film well worth watching. I loved hearing the Aphex Twin song throughout the movie, the lesser roles were done extremely well.. including phoenix who i can't stand in almost everything else he's been in. i'm typing now to get my 10 requisite lines in for this review. i don't want to be blocked so i'm goign to keep on typing and not put la la la la la.	8
 Good, well made, gritty film... but deeply disturbing		8
 oh yes	intense, gritty, spooky and deranged, but hey that's what we all love about the seedier side of life, isn't that right? nothing like the swooshing sound of a machete swinging round and round.nothing like a little fear to break you out of your self-induced hysteria, that my Lil friend really gets the blood to curdling.true, the movie could have been more defined at times, after all it was a quasi-expose but then again, would we have noticed.the thing about snuff is, that ppl all claim to not have watched one, but with TV shows like the shield, COPS, CSI, etc. we all perch watching in morbid fascination the results of this type of lifestyle.	8
 Will make you think twice before watching fetish porn	I don't normally watch thriller or mystery films, but a few friends were watching it and I decided to give it a chance. I was surprised to find that it was much better than I expected. I had always heard about snuff films and bondage, but I never really gave such things much thought. While certainly not perfect, the film is well worth watching even if you aren't particularly into the genre.Be warned, though, that it is quite brutal in places for obvious reasons. There are a few scenes involving graphic bondage/S&M porn of various sorts and a great deal of violence. To those unused to such levels of violence and sex, it may prove to be quite jarring, and it goes without saying that it will be disturbing in its implications (snuff films are real, after all).	8
" Cheapened remake of Paul Schrader's 1979 ""HARDCORE"""	"The film's plot is (too) reminiscent of Paul Schrader's ""HARDCORE"" (1979), but pales in comparison with it. Nicolas Cage's performance is compelling, yet less so than George C Scott's portrayal, 20 years earlier. The current film is more ""up to date"" in that it includes more gratuitous violence and foul language, but it lacks the pacing and quality image of the earlier film. ""Hardcore"" is a memorable film, while ""8 millimeters"" is a cheapened remake.Addt'l comment : are we supposed to be lured into some ""cinéma d'auteur"" claim by the title, and the fact that we see movie projectors running during the film (an anachronism in itself)? I didn't buy it."	5
 Extremely disturbing but the quality shines through		8
 society at its darkest	after seeing this film recently it struck me that our society doesn't really hold the porn industry in check as it once did. instead, pornography has permeated into our normal,commonplace institutions, the same sectors of our culture that seemed immune to this kind of infection just a short time ago. nowadays, porn stars do book signings and participate in reality shows. fringe Hollywood stars resort to pornographic behavior to capture our attention when cast on ensemble game shows. 8mm and Shumacher simply reenforce this concept that we as a society cannot escape the clutches of pornography. the porn psyche dominates and fuels the internet, advertising, sporting events, and other mass media forms of entertainment. is it so surprising that Mary Ann Mathews is swallowed by the porn monster? wouldn't we all like to fight back like Tom Welles? doesn't he break down at the sight of his baby daughter because she may someday be consumed by the nightmare of pornography and the people who produce it?	
" ""When you dance with the devil, the devil don't change... the devil changes you."""		
 Give it a chance		7
 disturbing, but without a doubt a must see!	"8mm is a great movie, without a doubt its in my top 10This movie has the same kind of disturbing topic than se7en, of course it has the same screenwriter, but I think this one's way better. If you're sick and tired of corny endings this movie is for you, this is what reality looks like.***SPOILERS (kind of)*** my favorite quotes: Tom Welles: ""I'll never get tired of hurting you Eddie"" (when the private detective is beating the sh*t of one of the snuff film makersMachine: ""What did you expected, a monster?"" (when the killer loses his mask and reveals his face)awesome moviemy rating: 9 out of 10 (10 being perfection)"	
 It took three times before I saw all of this film	This is not a film for all. As Nick Cage was in made it a had-to view. He is a private investigator hired to get to the real bottom. The bottom being a snuff film victim. It exposes his too real encounters along the seedy way.Characters are well cast. Not for kids. It chills and frightens to the max.	9
 Dark and Disturbing....	"I saw this film a couple of years ago.  It really did scare me in parts. It plays off the old urban legend of snuff films; that women are being abducted off the street and killed on film, for the enjoyment ofperverts.  These perverts will pay ridiculous prices for viewing these films, hence the motivation for the ""filmmakers"".  Of course, not a single case of this has ever happened.  But that doesn't stop 8mm from exploiting this fear. This film is not for everyone.  Naturally, with subject matter ofsnuff films and s&m, the picture will be dark and offensive to many. Joaquin Phoenix did a great job as Cage's sidekick."	6
 Awsome movie, nicholas at his beat	I thought this was a really well diredcted film.  It starts out with Nicholas Cage being called to do a private investigatng job for a very, very rich old man who has just passed away.  The mans wife and lawyer find a snuff film in his personal safe and hire Nicholas Cage to fide out if it is real and who made it. This is a great begining.  It gives you, the audience, and Nicholas a mission, and for the rest of the movie everyone is on the edge of their seat trying to figure out what happened.  It is like a journey really.  The end is fairly shocking and sick, but amazing none the less. This is a great movie and I would recommend it to just about everyone.	10
 Underrated and very disturbing	The first time I saw this movie I was about 16 y.o. and thought I could handle films like this... After the first hour my friend who was watching it with me, left because he felt sick - and all because of the movie. I also felt sick, but managed to sit though the whole movie.The thing with 8mm, is that it isn't as grafic as, say Requiem For A Dream, but this only lets you imangine all the gory details yourself, and this really emphasizes the effect of being very disturbing. This is why I think it is so underrated - some people just NEED to be served gore and grusomeness before they are shocked.*SPOILER* The best example of this is the snuff tape itself. You see the little girl and the large man in S/M leather gear, and IMAGINE what's gonna happen to her... Then you see her cry, and the guy pulls out a machette knife.. If you don't have enough imagination to visualise what happens next, you've played to many video games.The cast is amazing, but sadly doesn't live up to its full potential.**** out of ******	8
 Dark and Disturbing, but i cant look away...	This movie is well worth watching if you can stomach it.  It will take you deep into the darkest pits of hell in pornography and snuff.  Quite fascinating really.  Although it is not as good as writer Andrew Kevin Walker's SE7EN, but it certinly comes close.  i give it a good solid 10/10	
 Dark and Gritty	I knew this would one of those films most people wouldn't like because of it's dark subject matter. It's not a film you'd watch if you want good-natured escapism, but it is one you'd watch if you want a gripping storyline and can tolerate disturbing subject matter.The film makes observations about the fact that extreme material like snuff actually exists and that others are affected by whoever is maimed on camera (providing the footage is not faked).Nicholas Cage (a favourite actor of mine) does an excellent job as always, and I liked that they included some really extreme Drum 'n Bass (if that's the correct category) at the end.Don't listen to other people's recommendations, see it for yourself!	
 S&M = Murder?		
 It's meant to be dark and disgusting you morons!	Honestly! I can't believe the sheer stupidity of alot of the people who have commented on this film. It's a brilliant film, but like Blair witch, people are looking at it through the wrong viewscope. Although this film obviously does have some of the conventions of mystery and noir films, it just isn't supposed to be a genre film, it's a film in it's own merit which is what sets it apart. Now for everyone who's complaining about how dark and sick the film is, would you honestly much rather that the world of snuff films was shown in a positive happy light as though it isn't a bad thing, downplaying the whole sick world?!? You idiots! You'd be the first to shout out if that was done, saying that it was glorifying the world, you people just don't know what you want! Although the film I felt messed itself up towards the end(spoiler alert)when Cage gets caught by the makers of the films, and makes his lucky escape, the statement that the killer makes at the end by saying that he is what he is because of who he is, not because what was done to him, was done in such a way to really make a statement against the whole arguement of whether killers and weirdos are the products of themselves or of their environments. A very important issue in society, that I felt was addressed very well.The film has balls, and like the director said, too many directors wouldn't do a film like that, because they want everyone to love them, so you have to give him credit for that, even if you don't have the intestinal fortitude or intelligence to appreciate the film.Despite how well shot it was however, I still didn't like some lame attempts that were made to make the film a noir/mystery/cop film hybrid, if he'd have stayed true to the film instead of the conventions, and the acting all round was more solid, this film would have gained a 10, but as it stands, i think only an 8 is fair. It's a brilliant film though, but obviously not for the squeamish given it's content.Accept it for what it is, not what it tries to be.	8
 A bit overwrought due to Nicolas Cage	Joel Schumacher returned to his earlier, grittier form of film making with this telling tale of pornography and murder. While he took a major career slip with Bad Company, hopefully he will regain some of his former magic and stop being a hack. Anyway, I felt the performances of Peter Stormare and Joaquin Phoenix were quite good in this film, but they weighed down by the fact Nicolas Cage was over acting in most of his scenes. The dark production design also aided in the power of this film, with all of the decrepit browns and blacks filling up the screen with tension. While this isn't necessarily a tremendous film, it is certainly one worth watching, even it proves to be a hit or miss with most people.	6
 Joel Schumacher continues to disappoint.	This film was promoted as being an intense thriller, but it's not.  As a matter of fact, the film is way too slow to allow itself to be intense. Cage plays a boring private detective who stumbles onto a strange case involving what appears to be a murder on film.  As he begins to investigate the validity of the film, he finds himself getting deeper and deeper into the world of underground porn.  This film has an interesting premise, but just doesn't seem to build on it the way you would expect.  The pacing is erratic, and Schumacher relies too much on shock value, and not enough on storytelling.  This is however the same man who gave us the fourth, and by far the worst of the Batman films.  I also expected more from the writer of Seven.  Cage should stick to action, and Schumacher should just stop directing for a while and learn how to light a film.  With the exception of an effectively creepy performance by Peter Stormare, there's just not much reason to see this one.	3
 Another $6.50 you'll never see again...	"Nicolas Cage's slow (and I mean, really, really slow) descent into hell in Eight Millimeter is mind-numbing.  About 45 minutes into the movie when I realized it was beginning to suck, I looked at my watch and was mystified to see there was another hour and a half to go. I was really rooting for this movie to succeed, as I greatly enjoyed Seven, and both were written by Andrew Kevin Walker.  But for whatever reason, the tight structure and mood of the previous film are gone here.  I'm partial to blame Schumacher, after he made A Time To Kill with glistening actors and turned Batman into a $120 million joke. A real fault in the movie, in my view, is lack of a truly great screen villain.  Peter Stormare is the only one to come close, but his limited screen time is wasted.  ""We did it for the money,"" as a motivation is really tired. As for the hyped shocking scenes of this movie, if you consider a hefty man in a leather mask shocking, well, you're in for a treat.  Otherwise, the events of Seven were far more stunning than anything in this film. The message the film delivers is beaten into your brain for two and a quarter hours.  I think you'd be better off with Seven instead."	2
 An uneven mess.	"While this film has many good scenes, overall they don't work together as an overall movie.  At first, the sleuthing is interesting and well-done.  But once Joaquin Phoenix character is no longer part of the action, the film loses steam, and goes on and on after the solution has been reached.  What is meant to be ""shocking"" is outright boring.  The film doesn't even come close to being as disturbing as so many others out there.  Not recommended."	5
 SLOWWWWWW	"Not worth the $.  Very slow.  Plot was thin.  Cage had no reason to go as ""crazy"" as he did when trying to find the girl.  They made it seem like an obsession when he had no reason to.  The movie was over and they kept it going for an additional 20 min. and that part was the worst. Not worth it. Very disappointed"	3
 Not as good as it looks	This movie may receive a lot of good reviews, it may be highly regarded in Hollywood circles, but the fact remains that it's boring and unentertaining. Cut about 40 minutes from it, it may be better. It starts out okay, but starts to become too dark and foreboding, to the point where you lose interest in the characters and the story. The plot really starts to drag, and the big revelation of the Machine's identity becomes riddled with needless speech/pulpit preaching.  The directing, like most of Schumacher's movies is overstylized. Cage still gives a good performance, but it's one of those movies where you lose the ability to identify with what decisions the main character starts making. Wait for video, and only rent it if Se7en is checked out.	3
 The best movie in 1999...	This is the best Nicholas Cage-movie and It's one of my favoritemovies. A thrilling movie with terrible scenes that make you scream. I can't understand that this movie has bad votes! This movie is just great!!!!!!!!!!!	7
 Gritty and disturbing	8mm is a great movie. But probably not for everyone. It's very graphic and disturbing. But it's very powerful and it in no way makes light of its subject matter (snuff films). The violence is very realistic and the graphic sex is almost sickening at times (just as another warning) Nicolas Cage's performance in this movie is one of his best. My rating: 9/10	9
 Suprised me		7
" Lame Hollywood-ised look at ""the dark side""."	'8MM' is yet another example of Hollywood dumbing down potentially confronting and disturbing material. Directed by hack Joel Schumacher, and written by the guy who gave us the overrated 'Se7en', I suppose you'd have to be a fool to expect this trite look at snuff movies and extreme porn to be any good. There are some talented actors here, especially Cage, Phoenix and Gandolfini, but the material they have to work with is so superficial and unchallenging that no matter how hard they try the movie is beyond saving. '8MM' doesn't succeed as a thriller or a Paul Schraderesque journey into the dark side of contemporary America. It is a sham, a phony, a fake. Don't bother.	
 Depressing look at people	"8MM is a dark view at human society today. It shows the underground porn-circuit,and more in detail the so-called ""Snuff-movies"" where people are actually taped on 8mm while being killed.Nicolas Cage takes his part as always with charisma and emotion which he beautifully displays throughout the film. The Visual aspect of the Film is overwhelming and it will give you a very depressing feeling.""There's no good or justice in this world"", but as long Nicolas Cage gives the Message,it's all fine with  me.>"	8
 Well made		8
 Well made,Great acting misunderstood	I think this was a great movie. but it's not for those with a weak stomachI think people that gave this film a bad review either simply didn't get it! Or just couldn't take the graphic scene's (which i admit it got pretty bad sometimes)What I think this movie is trying to show up is that there really are monsters in the world. And it's not going to to be some devil with fangs and claws. It might be your neighbor,mailman,a coworker*SPOILER* how i figured this is when machine takes off his mask he looks like just an average guy. Another face in the crowd. Many of us have got this image in our minds that a murderer or rapist is going to be a real evil looking person. I guess thats what really shocked me the most about this film is seeing machines face.	10
 Not for the faint of heart	"Who would have thought that Joel Schumacher, having made complete garbage such as the latest Batman-movies, could make anything this cool? This time it is not about the effects or the scenery. It is about the good story and (most of all) the devil inside yourself. No graphic gore or violence, but a disturbing theme that is more realistic (and thus frightening) than ""Night of the zombie flesh'n'blood holocaust IV"". I do not think that this movie deserves anything less than a solid 8½. If you are in to thrillers, suspense, whodunnit, or even horror, this is a must-see. Maybe I should add that i think Nicholas Cage is a REALLY cool actor!"	9
 So Glad I didn't see this in the theaters	I am so glad that I didn't waste $8 on seeing this movie in the theaters. In fact, I got this movie for free!  And I still feel cheated! This movie has left me speechless.  I can't think of the right words to tell you just how bad this movie was!  Needless to say, I did not enjoy it.  I can't say this movie grossed me out or made me sick, but I was surprised at how much nudity there was in this flick.  There is not much to enjoy about this movie. Joquin Phoenix gave a great performance as did Nic Cage to a lesser degree.  He seems to have the same mood in almost all of his movies as of late (excluding Family Man). All in all, this movie has no rewarding value, the climax sucks, so does most of the rising action.  So, if you want to spend a couple of bucks to completely and utterly waste a perfectly good 2 hours, I wouldn't even reccommend you do so on this flick.  Waste it on a flick for your kids that will at least make someone feel good.  Try a Bug's Life!	
 wake up call	i knew a little of what i could expect. i am a fan of nicolas cage and it's a pleasure to see his work. i was impressed to see his performance in this movie. even though the topic isn't average, i think it is necessary that we aren't in the dark about sex. if you know nothing you'll become a victim. the movie shows that it is so easy to become caught in a negative spiral of people, sex and money. it makes you do things you wouldn't normally do. even though cage doesn't want to see or believe what he saw, he wants to make things right again. the price he has to pay is as high as they get. the truth is worse as depicted here but for a g i jane like me, the movie made me think. there are people for whom this is every day live. and if the public doesn't know they cannot stop it.	9
 God works in mysterious ways.	I challenge anyone to name a superior neo-noir.  ('90 - '00)Really.{Disclaimer:  I do oppose murder, porno, sleezy lawyers & producers. ;-}}	
 Dull Edge.	"For a movie that was touted as being ""in the vein of _Seven_,"" this one totally missed the mark. Nick Cage sleepwalks through this. Catherine Keener, a remarkable actress, has absolutely nothing to do in this film, and i wonder why she bothered taking such a thankless role. Shumacher was definely trying to give the look of _Seven_, but his Hollywood-glitz tendencies always shone through, giving everything a phony sheen. There was simply no edge to this film at all."	3
 Not one of Nick's better ones	Wooden acting and not enough emotion, or the wrong emotion from Nicolas Cage. The subject matter is meant to draw the audience in, but it is a letdown. Worth watching if only for the slimeball tough guy performance by James Gandolfini, now forever famous for playing Tony Soprano. He really steals the show out from under the lead actor. Too dark and brooding just for the sake of being so. Really just an over-hyped rather thrown together disappointment.	6
 truly disturbing - horrid	i can't even describe how sick and disturbing this movie was! Seven at least was scary and it had a good ending. this was just weird and sick. i enjoyed some parts of gore but very few there were. plus they killed off the only interesting character (and funny as well) which was Max. absolutely horrid. 2 out of ***** stars	
 This movie is okay.	This movie is okay because I liked about a Private Investigator Tom Wells (Nicolas Cage) trying to solve a 6 year old mystery about a girl being killed on film.  He tries to find a man who is behind the mask that killed that girl.  I wasn't squismish about the violence or the sexuality of the film, it was entertaining to me.  Even though I was scared for 30 seconds towards the end of the film, but I liked it.	
 A very disturbing film. I will never watch it again.		
 Effectively disturbing but way too long	8mm is a movie I didn't want to see because it seemed to me like another SnakeEyes.  I was wrong.  Director Joel Schumacher does a nice job of putting the film together, but he tends to drag out scenes here like he did with Batman & Robin and A Time to Kill.  The storyline is interesting, but Cage unusually  lacks depth and the two main women (his wife who was very good in Out of Sight) and the woman who hires him are not effective at all. Kudos to Joaquin Phoenix and James Gandolfino who put in very nice performances.  Overall I would call it very dark, very disturbing, but worth catching one day on HBO or Cinemax.	6
 10	"I love this movie, but one must watch it more than once to catch the details.  The first time you see this movie the shock of it will disturb you. (If not you are very hardened)  Its theme ""If you dance with the devil the devil doesn't change you change"" is revealed threw this movie; It shows what is evil' how it works, and the effect's it has on a good man(Tom Wells).  Watch Bambi if you want fun entertainment, and stay away from this one if you do not want to be disurbed by it."	
 A sick movie	Simply put, this is a sick movie.  I can stomach alot of gore and violence, and have been known to sit through the worst of slasher movies without flinching, but this movie made me nautious.  If you are smart, you won't waste the money.	
 A sick movie, but for all the wrong reasons	The most disturbing thing about this movie is its morale: There are really bad guys out there, and killing them doesn't make the world a good place, but at least a better one. Hey, it's a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it. Now, THAT is scary.	
 Hardly Cage's Best		6
 That movie like me	Is a good movie, but only N. Cage did a good perfomance, the others guys are weak in their runs. The screenplay is the better part of the work. The movie show one of the worst part of the actual society, sick and losing values.	7
 Don't waste your time	I had the misfortune of seeing this movie recently and I want to warn the world!  This is an ugly, ugly movie & there are no characters to care about, despite the efforts of Nicholas Cage, who seems extraordinarily wooden in this role.  (Joaquin Phoenix is good in a smaller role, though. His is the only appealing character in the film.) I should have known that I wouldn't like this one bit since it's from Joel Schumacher.  I haven't liked any of his films, and after 8MM, I will be avoiding him.  But I can't blame the director entirely;  this script is so unappealing, one wonders why anyone would want to produce it?  After seeing this movie, I wanted to watch Bambi or something as an antidote.	3
 For those who understand	I enjoyed 8mm. I thought the film was well constructed, but lacked the enthusiasm at certain junctures which would have made it a blockbuster. Going through other comments makes me realize that only a select few can comprehend what is really going on. I think you have to know what Tom Wells went through to appreciate the movie. The devil does change you.	10
 8 mm wide, not an inch deep	"Apart from the fact that the whole idea was actually borrowed from another movie made years ago, I was appalled at the way the director handles all (I mean all) situations as if they were booby traps undermining our family values and our little but happy lives. The movie can be seen successful if a director unveiling his ideas so overtly and obviously is forgiven in that sense. I was almost disgusted to see the same schemes as in Se7en, the same grayish green colors, even the same rain. I was angry with myself to have been watching Nicolas Cage, after a disaster like The City of Angels. I loathed to see a placard reading ""way strong"" or ""way hard to swallow"" or something like that.Although, I must admit that we had a quite fun with my friends right after the screening, joking over our little, pathetic, vicious, pornography touched lives, and happy that Nicolas Cage is returned home to his coward, pitiful wife who doesn't even have the courage to dump him forever after she leaves him. There's just one thing good about this flick, and that is the emerging star brother of River Phoenix, Joaquin (formerly Leaf)"	6
 long, very long	A short comment: Too long. Too bored. I was very sorry to see it. Good music.	
 Cage, what were you thinking?	"I am a big fan of Nicolas Cage.  I loved ""Face/Off,"" loved ""Con Air,"" and loved ""Snake Eyes,"" but he had to go and make this awful film.  I don't know what people think are intense about a film which has 20% of time in a room searching papers about a missing girl and another 20% with Cage and the girl's mom talking in an unbelievably boring tone and pace.  This movie was hyped up as a thrill ride, it was not.  It is a murder/mystery, but of course you have no idea if the girl was actually murdered or not till the end.  Joaquin Phoenix was pretty decent in this as the porn pro.  There is no interesting points in this movie, that is, I don't find snuff films interesting, but hey that's just me.  This movie, because of its writer is compared to ""Se7en,"" a really good film, but ""8mm"" has no surprise ending, which is what I expected and the soundtrack to this film, the background music and score, made me want to throw up.  Thankfully, Cage will be in an upcoming movie with Scorsese, that should be a winner."	3
 An average thrill.		6
 Awesome movie, shame about the cast.		9
 8mm from director of Se7en, but just 5 & dime	"The trailers were so good, but the film was so weak.  I'm not a Nic Cage fan to begin with, but this is not one of his top performances. One would be better off renting ""Hardcore"" with George C. Scott and Season Hubley if curious about the snuff-film underworld.  One saving grace -- another terrific performance by James Gandolfini of HBO's ""The Sopranos"" and ""A Civil Action."""	6
 8mm does not deal with the subject matter as honestly as it should have.		6
 Try not to puke	I was amazed this film didn't receive an nc-17 rating. A lot of scenes were graphic and disgusting. I got the impression that most of the other people in the theatre were trying not to throw up.However, I liked the film overall. Cage did a lot better than in other movies I have seen him in, and for once, I actually felt sympathy for his character. The director took a few chances with daring angles and unusual cinematography.Not for the squeamish, but a good film nonetheless.	7
 This was not a good movie!	This was one of those movies where you leave feeling like a worse person than before. I immediately had to take a shower I felt so dirty. It literally ruined my day. It was sad, disgusting, depressing, and violent. The only decent part of the movie was the cinematography. Unless you enjoy extremely dark movies, I strongly recommend skipping 8MM!	1
 Schumacher takes what could have been a complex journey into darkness and desire and makes it a poor teenage cop thriller dressed up in adult clothes (minor spoilers)	Tom Welles is a private investigator who is keen to get mixed with a high level clientele.  He takes on the case of a wealthy widow who's husband has just died.  In his safe she found what appears to be a porno-snuff movie where a young girl is killed by a masked man.  He investigates whether the tape is real or not with the help of adult bookshop worker Max California and finds a disturbing underworld as he tries to track down the makers.I greet the words `A Joel Schumacher Film' with dread.  Since `Batman & Robin' I have decided not to pay to watch another of his films ever again  I will not have it on my conscience to keep this man in a job.  Here he proves himself to be a director with a skill for visual flair but to be a hollow and vapid as a man can be when it comes to sense.  Worse than that, he is a coward.The plot here held my attention for the first hour.  The world of porn is always interesting because I'll never know what it is like, I'll never feel what it is like inside and I'll never see this underbelly that exists. However the film does nothing with this early promise.  Instead it chickens out and becomes a vigilante thriller  that makes it easy for Schumacher. The darkness that is hinted at in Walker's script is never really brought out  all the characters are one-dimensional and poor.  Schumacher fails to explore any of them and takes the easy way out.Machine is the only decent character here and he is wasted in a tense, but disappointingly played `good versus evil' style climax.  Schumacher was not the man to do this  he can only direct visuals and even that is starting to look like a thing of the past.  Falling Down is probably the closest thing he did to a complex character, but even then he chickened out and the film was less as a result.  I blame him for the failure of this movie  but I thank God that Walker's script for Se7en was given to a director capable enough to handle the darkness.  Schumacher should only be allowed to direct children's films.The performances are really average considering the cast.  Cage was ONCE a good actor.  Here he is let down by bad direction.  You can almost hear Schumacher saying `Nick, you know that intense, disturbed look you do? Well can you do that for the whole film please?'.  It's that bad, it really is one-dimensional.  Cage tries hard but his character is so badly written and the slide into a vigilante is unconvincing.  Phoenix is actually good and is the sort of honest guide we needed, but once he is gone then that's that. Gandolfini, a man of immense talent when given good roles is terrible, short scenes and 1D.  Stormare is just as bad.  Bauer is only given one scene to do a good job and he manages it with a few lines of dialogue to explain himself  but Schumacher sacrifices him in the name of a traditional climax.Overall this starts well but really never goes near the darkness it hints at.  Schumacher cannot do anything other than `good versus evil' simple stories and this is too much for him to handle.  His weakness shines through in most of the film despite a few good scenes and a good Phoenix.  At one point in the film Max says `you're going to see things you'll wish you could un-see'.  He was referring to this film - a traditional cop thriller dressed up as a grownup journey into darkness.	
 As Bad As Any Feature Film Can Get!	This one can easily be categorized as: Why people should take some critics reviews seriously.  This film is bad! Not the worst I've ever seen - but in the top 20...  Nicolas Cage should be careful about the films he chooses. First this one, and now the newly released flop about the ambulance guy - who see's dead people. Dont get me wrong, I love Nicholas Cage, and Patricia Arquette, but their new sicko films (did anyone see Stigmata) just aint makin' it.	1
 Really lame	"I usually really like Nicolas Cage, but he STUNK in this one.  He genuinely ""sleep-walked"" through this entire performance.  I know I was supposed to feel for the victims, but the story was so poorly written, the dialogue so silly (does ANYONE have a marriage like the one portrayed in the movie?), that I just really didn't care.  He better get his stuff together because between ""Con Air"", ""Snake Eyes"", and ""8mm"", he's on a pretty steep downward spiral.  Sean Penn can be a real jerk, but his criticism of Cage's choice in movies lately is right on."	1
 No thank you !	"For me Nicolas Cage is boredom personified, so that's my first reason to say: No thank you !Joel Schumacher has directed ""8MM"". I've always thought he's lousy, and with this one he doesn't prove me wrong.The script is written by Andrew Kevin Walker, who has previously written ""Seven"", which I think is a masterpiece. ""8MM"" however is really disappointing.I didn't like ""8MM"" because it's boring and uninterresting. So there's not much more to say except: No thank you !"	
" The entire film seemed to be little more than an excuse to show clips from a ""snuff"" movie."	"I think this film was born when some producer somewhere said ""I bet alot of people would go see a movie that had snuff movie-like scenes in it"".  The next thought was to dress it up as if it was an exploration of some aspect of the nature of humanity. Like ""Seven"" it is very light on substance and high on style which might fool some into thinking it is actually about something."	1
 really a bad film	I should say it is wasting time to watch such a movie! The average score is really too high for this. Nicolas Cage acted as a bad killer finder in this film.I cannot believe he is the guy who play a role in The Rock and Faceoff!	1
 More cliches than Debbie does Dallas	"This film wouldn't be so bad if it weren't trying so hard. Schumacher seems to have aimed at taking a long, hard look at the hardcore porn industry but any depth is lost in a string of ""action film"" cliches. (The final answer to the question ""why this violence?"" seems to be ""because I felt like it"" - which could be interesting if done properly, but not when preceded and followed by scenes of the familiar hero-straining-to-reach-gun-behind-iron fence sequence.) Nicolas Cage is a terrific actor but otherwise, why bother?"	1
 Just Say 'No'	"""8MM"" purports to be a frightening and disturbing drama about the underworld of pornography.  It is actually a boring, melodramatic and drawn-out film that was as poorly written as it was acted.  Cage is unusually unconvincing and no character is strong enough to warrant sympathy or revulsion."	1
 A truly terrible film	"I saw this film with only a rough brief about the plot and the recomendation of a friend who saw the trailer.I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage but his performance here wasn't even half-hearted;giving the impression that he had no conviction in what he was doing.This is hardly surprising as the script was one of the worst I have seen in the cinema for a long time, pretentious and predictable.As a film editor I found the cutting childlike and simplistic (i.e. Three dissolve jump cuts as he walks to the warehouse- come on!) A great idea for a film but just badly executed in a 'Hollywood formula' kind of way. You know what's going to happen next and the big twist near the end where the bad guy is revealed can be seen coming from a mile off. If the concept of this film interests you then I suggest you watch Paul Schrader's ""Hardcore"" with George C.Scott for a true feeling of what I think this film was trying to achieve"	1
 What's this?	"So, this is supposed to be radical? Just listen to Nick Cage's   words: ""Please, give me permission to avenge your daughter's death!"" Or even worse: ""Save me"", as he cries in her wife's lap. But, when I think again, what could we expect from a director such as Scumacher? Has he made a decent movie yet? This is kindergarten stuff, NOT a disturbing movie."	1
 Absolutely repulsive.	I wanted to leave half way through.  Not only because of its disgusting content, but because it was boring.  I left the theater literally sick to my stomach.  I have only one question to ask the creators of the move and that is why?  Your movie did not make me think how horrible the world of snuff films are, but how horrible the world of Hollywood is with their shock value.  This movie was a waste of my money and time.	1
 Probably The Worst Movie Ever Made	This movie may be the worst movie I have ever seen. It actually is one of a handful of movies that I have given my minus rating to, in this case a -10. My minus ratings go to a movie who's content is so negative and horrible with the only intent to make a person feel worse for having encountered it. These type of movies just should never have been made, period. Forget the acting quality, the realism, the script, etc that should normally indicate a quality piece of film making. This film was not made for any other reason than to make people feel worse for having watched it....to introduce people to something that is disgusting and disturbing. I've seen plenty of movies with violence and gore in them, but 8mm is not like those movies ...its in a class by itself....the lowest class there is.	1
 the worst movie I have ever seen	My respect for Nicolas Cage completely deflated after seeing 8MM.  I was shocked at the general publics acceptance and interest in the film and the unbelivable remarks of the film having artistic and creative qualities. It repulsed me as a woman and a person; the use of violence is for the sake of violence.  I left the theater and almost vomited.	1
 Very disturbing...	A private investigator finds himself mixed up in world of perverse sex and snuff movies. The movie is descriptive and graphic. 8mm is probably the most disturbing movie I have ever seen. It bothered me to think that there may be people actually involved in this.	1
 Yuck !!!	this is the absolute WORST movie i have ever seen - what a waste of good money for such trash - it made No sense what so ever, i was totally lost - i would strongly advise that No one rent this crap - because you'd probably end up returning the movie after the first few minutes of itit was a shame for Nicolas to waste his talent on this movie, he is a Great actor whom i admire very much and i was disappointed that he'd stoop so low to act in this movie - i was unfortunate enough to have to pay to see this junk at the theater - so save your money and rent another one of Nicolas's movies , not this one , and it actually deserves a zero it was that bad	1
 are you kidding?	"Although this movie is not disturbingly gory and does not have so much nudity that it will make you vomit, 8mm is just plain DUMB. snooweatinganima was right, there are so many cliches in the damn thing that it's impossible to take it seriously.  Although I have to admit that ""the machine"" was one of the more humorous characters I have ever scene on film. He bore a pleasant resemblance to Bane from Batman & Robin, another noble attempt by the amazing Joel Schummacher.  Make sure that when you see this movie that you aren't watching it on a dark stormy night, in a slum, next to a cemetery, on a broken TV, with loud scary techno music blasting in the background, or god forbid, you might be attacked by a group of bloodthirsty hard-core porno makers!"	1
 The worst movie I've ever seen.	The plot is ridiculous and the fact that the characters are unilateral, strange and dumb does not help. There's a character (The Monster) that was obviously intended to have some deep symbolic meaning, but instead, the character is pathetic and downright laughable. I wanted to punch Nicholas Cage for accepting a such a terrible role in such a unforgivable movie.	1
 The theater wouldn't give me my money back		1
 For a movie about a snuff film, it's OK on some levels	Nicolas Cage plays an unlucky detective who is assigned to do some dirty work. If you think about it, he's also an unlikely choice in some ways. Is the movie entertaining? It is when he is not at the adult video store or around the bad guys (or anyone who seems like they might be). Joauquin Phoneix's character isn't very interesting. Basically, the movie meanders and the sequence where the bad guys are beating Cage up isn't particularly convincing or interesting. Oh, and in a strange twist (if you want to call it that), turns out the man who gave Cage this assignment is not a nice man after all. The movie gets off to a great start and holds your attention for a while, but the more we are told about the case, the less we care.**1/2 out of ****	
 Dark, sinister but nonetheless gripping		6
 Don't Analyze this, just enjoy 8MM	WellI have to say that I enjoyed spending 2 hours on this film. Why is it that critics analyze this kind of movie? When it was a Jan de Bont or Paul Verhoeven movie they say, those Dutchman, they can make a good action movie. This one is a good action movie, just like Basic Instinct or Silence of the Lambs. But now it's a movie with Cage as the hero who saves his soul by getting some bad guys. There's no deeper level, only if you want to find one. So don't analyze this, just enjoy 8mm.	5
 A disgusting mess.		
 Well done thriller		7
 Lame	"I was excited to see this movie because I had heard good things. Then I watched it. I have not been so disappointed in a long time. The guy before me said there was no ""Hollywood ending"" however I thought the ending was very Hollywood and the constant bullshit plot twists were extremely lame. It DRAAAAGGGEEEEDDDD on forever in the end. I found my self skipping the final chapters out of boredom. Don't waste your time. Go watch Man Bites Dog, Guinea Pig or Cannibal Holocaust if your looking for a brutal movie. They are WAAYY better. W A YBetter."	2
 Disappointing subtext	While going after sordid snuff flicks (and who would argue with that?), Schumacher manages to communicate a powerful subtext about American attitudes toward sex: that human sexuality is bad. Problem is, Schumacher does nothing to indicate there's any other view. Every character in the movie seems to have either a lousy sex life (the Cage character) or a guilt-ridden and perverse sex life (everyone else). I doubt that Schumacher intended this result, but the overriding feeling in the flick is that all active sexuality inevitably spirals downward into perversity---a distinctly American attitude. If the mass American film audience was more sophisticated---and this is a film geared toward a mass audience, not a critical one--- that would seem less problematical. As it is, I am disappointed when I think of a subtext absorbed by so many unlikely to question it.	4
 Coulda Shoulda Woulda		
 Long, boring and bad...	"Nick Cage is another one of those guys who's movies career has been on a downward spiral over the past several years.  Yes, he keeps getting roles but the movies are uniformly bad.  ""Gone in 60 Seconds"", ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"", and especially ""8mm"".  The premise is intruiging, as any mystery is at the beginning of the film.  By time you get to the end, which is a very loooooooooong time from the beginning, it's a different movie and you really don't care if he solves the mystery or not.  You just want the movie to stop."	4
 Not a Good movie	I did not like this movie . Though the theme is good , the story goes into too much details of sexual abuse, violence and I find it all unnecessary and awful. However If you agree to the story , it has been well pictured and everybody has performed  very well. But I strongly disapprove the sexual abuse and level of violence depicted in the film and I will not recommend for anybody anytime.	2
 potential, but failed	"I was excited for about the first 10 minutes, then the movie just took a downward spiral down the tube. I loved Seven so I hoped this movie would be as good. I received a huge let down. Almost everything about this movie was horrible.Possible spoilersBad story, bad acting, bad characters: the list goes on.  The plot line of the movie, ""If you dance with the devil, the devil doesn't change, he changes you."" Sounds pretty cool, right? By the time you get to see Cage's character change, you really don't give a damn. This is one of Cage's worst performances that I've seen. Joaquin Phoenix's character is the only person you have the slightest care for and that went nowhere.1 out of 4. Don't waste your time."	5
 pretty sickening		3
 Such a waste -- time, energy, talent, AND money!		2
 Predictable; cast capable of more	"This movie was fair; it had a couple of ""moments""; times when a bad guy would jump out and scare you, but overall disappointing.  I would blame it on the script; the cast of this show was incredible, and had members that could have truly lifted this movie to new heights of ""eerieness"".  I found the story to be totally predictable with only a couple of subtle exceptions.I hope this type of film does not become the norm for Nicholas Cage; after this, ""Face Off"", ""Snake Eyes"", and ""Con-Air"", I am regretably beginning to question the movies that this otherwise talented actor is making, and he is becoming less of a draw for me.  I hope he will prove me wrong in the future."	4
" See ""Hard Core"" instead"		4
 A Typical Joel Schumacher Film	"8 mm is a film with little to recommend it other than the sensational subject matter. My main problem with this film is that it is dishonest about its motives. It is basically a vigilante film that pretends to be an exploration of the nature of evil and what drives people to it. The hero is given some minor flaws (he lies about smoking to his wife) but is otherwise a wholesome family man. Nicolas Cage's performance has been described by many as ""understated"", which I suppose is a euphemism these days for dull and lifeless. The villains have no redeeming features and the film seems to suggest that anyone involved in the sex industry must be a vicious pervert. Worst of all there is little genuine suspense, just some nasty scenes of people being brutally murdered."	4
 Truly Awe-FULL	"Saw this film when it was first released and it was just awful.  Since then, I have refused to see action/thriller films starring Nicholas Cage.  ""8mm"" is one of the most visually disturbing films I have ever seen (the others being ""Xiu Xiu"" and ""Boys Don't Cry"", which were good films).  It was hard to stomach some of the visuals and is most definitely not for the faint-of-heart or squeamish.  This gets a whopping 4 out of 10."	4
 I watched 8mm. It got to me. That's why these comments are so boring and stupid		4
 The last 50 minutes helped me to realize the movie was bad	The first 25 minutes of the film is okey, but the remains of the film isn`t, especially the last 40-50 minutes was very boring and predictable, even so boring i had to fast forward just to get finished with the film. My opinion relies on this, I didn`t really need to see a revenge movie, when Cage uses the last 40 minutes just killing of the bad guys it`s not what i expected and i didn`t like it. The movie was too dark and had extremely boring and ugly characters as well. My tips the next time is The Cannonball Run.	2
 A perfect date flick !		4
 Tourist in Hell		2
 Something Fundamentally Wrong	The points of this movie are fairly straightforward, namely, extreme pornography is bad, how would you feel if your daughter was abused by such people and absolute power corrupts absolutely (oh yes, and if you're bald, fat and wear spectacles then you are very likely to be involved in this sort of stuff (!)).These well-worn tenets aside, this movie has very little to offer. Given that Nick Cage is in control, the ending is predictably obvious and all the less satisfying for that. I recommend waiting for it to be shown on AMC or TNT (all the same violence but with those pesky swear words taken out).	4
 Boring, unsuspenseful, unshocking, waste of time		2
 routine, ugly thriller		4
 This film is sick	This film is not poorly made.  It actually is made fairly well. It is the content of this movie that makes it very disgusting and very demoralizing.  It will distort and warp your mind.  I recommend not viewing	4
 Solid thriller despite Cage,	I really enjoyed this movie but frankly I thought it would have done much better with a better starring actor. Nick Cage is not terrible but he is pretty bad...Rarely do you find people in Hollywood that put absolutely no emotion into their lines but Cage is definitely one of them. Other then that though the supporting cast did great and the movie was gritty and intense.This movie is about an investigator who is hired by a lady because she found a tape that belonged to her late husband. On the tape depicts a young girl being raped and murdered and the lady hires the invesitagor to find the young girl in the film to make sure its not actually a real snuff film.This movie was actually really good the only reason I give it a 7 is because of the main lead in the film personally I think Cage shouldn't be anywhere near it.	7
 Snuffing Out The Past	"Columbia Pictures should have kept ""8mm"" in the can. If you thought Nicolas Cage's previous movie ""Snakes Eyes"" was crappy, director Joel Schumacher's second-rate, slipshod, murder-mystery about a runaway girl, a snuff movie, and our pornographic society may alter your opinion. Co-starring Joaquin Phoenix and James Gandolfini, ""8mm"" lacks originality, kinky intensity, and catharsis. Although the filmmakers take audiences on a tour of the sleazy hindquarters of American society, ""8mm"" balks at pushing the envelope in its depiction of decadence. Never as disturbing as the Al Pacino movie ""Cruising,"" the George C. Scott film ""Hardcore,"" or the Charles Bronson's thriller ""Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects,"" this darkly lensed pseudo-suspenser simmers far too long before the plot comes to a boil. Fans of ""Se7en"" scenarist Andrew Kevin Walker may wonder how much Columbia diluted his script to yield such comatose claptrap.When an industrial czar's rich widow, Mrs. Christian (Myra Carter of ""The Witches of Salem: The Horror and the Hope""), opens her recently deceased husband's safe, she discovers what she suspects is a snuff movie. In this one-reel film, a young girl appears to die at the hands of a leather-clad sadist. The elderly Mrs. Christian hires clean-cut, buttoned-down Tom Welles, a small potatoes private eye, to determine the authenticity of the snuff film. Welles accepts the assignment without high hopes. He treats it as a missing person's case. Once he has identified the girl as May Anne Matthews (Jenny Powell), he contacts Mary Anne's working class mom (Amy Morton) and snoops around the runaway's room.The trail takes Welles to the West Coast where he hires a smart-aleck porno-store clerk, Max California (Joaquin Phoenix), with an encyclopedic knowledge of kink to guide him through the underworld of hardcore pornography. Max warns Tom before he begins his tour, ""There are things you're going to see that you can't unsee."" Max is a tough young man who has not let the filth and pornography affect him. When Tom Welles meets him, Max has a clover of a cheap porno novel wrapped around a copy of Truman Capote's bestseller ""In Cold Blood."" Throughout the case, Tom grapples with the question that bugs him about the dead millionaire: ""Why did he want to film a little girl being butchered?"" Tom keeps L.A. porno producer Eddie Poole (James Gandolini of ""True Romance"") under surveillance until Poole leads him to a guy who produced the snuff movie, the infamous Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare of ""Armageddon""), who has his headquarters in New York City.Tom and Max fly to the Big Apple, contact the fiendish Dino, and give him the front money for the movie. Tom has one condition: they must allow him to observe them as they film. At this point, Tom sends Max packing out of harm's way, before he confronts the pornographers in an abandoned warehouse at the edge of town. The killers surprise Tom and turn the tables on him. ""Satan ex machine,"" quips the nasty Dino with relish as he shows Tom that they knew about him from the start. Further disclosure would spoil what little suspense Schumacher conjures up.""Se7en"" scenarist Andrew Kevin Walker has inked a lukewarm murder-mystery yarn shot on surprises but long on clichés. The co-scenarist on ""Hideaway"" (1995), Walker provides standard set-pieces such as a rain swept graveyard fight, a ""Silence of the Lambs"" confrontation in a creepy house, an ""In Cold Blood"" style murder sequence, and a ""Death Wish"" vigilante hero. The villains epitomize stereotypical predators who pose little threat to the sanitized knight hero. The action plods more often than it pulsates. Obviously, Schumacher deploys atmosphere (i.e., set design) as a smoke screen to cover up the pornographic material that good taste and censorship prevent him from showing. Indeed, as prudish as ""8mm"" is, the filmmakers had to contrive something more than prurience to attract an audience.""8mm"" makes the most of Nicolas Cage and shows Joaquin Phoenix at his best. Cage imbues ""8mm"" with his unique brand of underdog charm and antithetical heroism. Cage plays Welles as a sad-faced Sam Spade with a nagging wife (Catherine Keener) and an infant daughter. Young, ambitious, mobile, and polished, Tom devotes himself to his family. When he isn't on a case, he's raking the front yard. Tom is the heart and soul of ""8mm,"" and the filmmakers make him tough, resourceful, but vulnerable and hen-pecked. Tom Welles serves as the conscience and custodian of morality of ""8mm."" A great deal of John Wayne's Ethan Edwards from director John Ford's ""The Searchers"" jostles for prominence in Nicolas Cage's performance. Eventually, Tom begins to obsess over poor Mary Anne Matthews and her plight. Cage struggles to make straight-arrow Tom Welles a flesh and blood fellow, but Schumacher doesn't abet him. Tom Welles doesn't have much of a back-story. ""8mm"" is another exercise in masculine control, and the film charts his growth from law-abiding private eye to lone vigilante.The bad guys in ""8mm"" wear their villainy like placards. Four villains menace Tom Welles, but the fourth is not unmasked until the climax. All deserve to die, and as the offal of humanity they earn miserable, ignominious deaths. As a porno-movie producer, Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini) elicits nothing but contempt as the kind of verminous scum who sodomizes women, guzzles liquor, curses blasphemously, and dresses like a lout. He is a repository of politically-incorrect and socially unacceptable traits. As another porno producer, Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare) hams it up with a crossbow and the beard of a vaudeville villain. Chris Bauer creates evil incarnate as 'Machine,' the leather-clad star of S & M videos who kills because he enjoys it. Machine's speech at the end of ""8mm"" serves as a commentary on the face of evil.Altogether, ""8mm"" is a dull, clammy, little exercise in voyeurism and perversion. Columbia Pictures and director Joel Schumacher couldn't have contrived a better bedtime story for the Super Court Justices to lull themselves asleep to than ""8mm."""	2
 No one should see a movie like this one.	"Two things bothered me about 8mm. I think that even simulated slasher scenes with young girls in underwear whimpering in primal fear as a masked (then unmasked) blade-wielder mugs for the camera before ""offing"" the victim is unsuitable for anyone to watch. The hype written about the masterful direction and intense acting of Cage can't paint this film as fit to watch. It's just plain grotesque. It reminds me of an old True magazine I saw as a boy that depicted a dog fight, all in glorious color photos. I didn't know such things existed and feel worse for knowing it.The other thing that bothers me is when Cage calls home on two occasions and asks how his daughter is. His corn pone wife answers the same both times: ""Aw, she's sweet"". What masterful direction indeed!"	2
 ABSOLUTELY YUK	I had no idea what this movie was about when I waltzed on in to the theatre to see it, but after finding out in the first few minutes, I thought oh no.The violent pornographic scenes were particularly disgusting, I found the victimisation of women and children disturbing. It showed the worst of pornography and the lowest of society. I only had a vague understanding of what 'snuff movies' were till I saw this!I found the comic-book background scenery and comic-book bad guys particularly annoying. I mean, check out the head honcho's seedy pad.  The bad guys also reeked of comic-book evilness ie the slimy acting, the bad dress sense, the guns (and other weaponry), the bad dialogue.It was overlong, slow and the half hour or so before the end, it picked up to the point of flying at jet speed, cliche-style. For example, Nicholas Cage gropes around for a weapon to use on the baddies and its just out of his reach. The badguy runs around the car to get the gun instead of under it (giving Nicholas enough movie time to get himself armed).  The baddies shooting each other.I found this movie to be apalling, disgusting and totally evil. I've also seen Se7en, it was heaps better than this.I rate this 3 out of 10.	2
 Easily one of the worst 5 movies I have ever seen	Let me preface this by saying I enjoyed this movie up until the last 5-10 minutes. It is a murder mystery with absolutely no mystery at all. The entire movie you find yourself trying to pick up little clues as Cage goes from one locale to the next trying to figure out what it is that Schumacher is going to try and shock you with. The problem lies in that this is completely fruitless in the end. There is no mystery to be solved although it is made to feel that way. Save your money here and read up on snuff films on wikipedia and then just watch the last 10 minutes of this film as that is the only part that has anything to do with the story. The rest is all just fluff. Cage is good as usual but at some point someone has to read the last few pages of his scripts for him. (See wicker man)	1
 Thanks heaps Gary	"Everyone has friends they like watching certain movies with. You normally watch romantic comedies with your woman, ridiculous actions movies with your wacky mates and comedies with your jokester friends. I have a genre which I'm not sure anyone else has. I have a friend, Gary, who takes me to see moves that disturb me for days, weeks or years. That's not to write him off and say he always picks boundary pushing movies, but he's aware of my low trust levels with him movie wise nowadays.The last movie I ever let Darren do this with was ""8mm"". Fair to say if he told me beforehand the movie was about a detective trying to uncover a snuff movie making industry, I would have said ""sounds great, but I might sit this one out."" Basically the movie revolves around a detective (Cage) falling upon a movie that shows someone being for real killed during a sex scene. As he searches he discovers there's a whole industry going on that he must uncover before more people die. Sounds crazy hey? As you can imagine there's some disturbing imagery, most of which my therapist says I'm over now. Not one for the kiddies"	1
 An incredible disappointment from talented filmmakers...	"Up to the point where Nicolas Cage -- as an investigator searching for the truth behind a Super 8 ""snuff"" film found in a dead banker's safe -- flies to New York, I could kind of buy a lot of the plot points in this movie. The pacing was good in the beginning, particularly in the scenes with Cage and the dead girl's mother. There was also some great interplay between Cage and Joaquin Phoenix, playing an employee of an adult bookstore who ""guides"" Cage through the seamy (and laughably implausible) 'underground world' of L.A. porn.  But all of the scenes after this began to stretch the boundaries of credibility. It was as if director Schumacher had watched too many James Bond films or something. It became so over-the-top and unbelievable that my friends and I (and a large part of the audience at the Hollywood Cinerama Dome) started to laugh at the so-called ""serious"" parts. The part where Cage hugs his wife and implored her to ""save me"" brought down the house! On one level this is a very funny movie. See it for laughs, or, better yet, if you are interested at all in the subject matter, watch the Paul Schrader directed film, ""Hardcore"" starring George C. Scott which is far better."	1
 really really really incredibly really bad	"Funny how i only submit reviews for bad movies; i guess i can't tell people what to like, just what not to like, or even give a chance to.  This film was bad.  That should be enough, but I'll elaborate.  Is the dissatisfied wife really a necessary element to this story, or was it just in there because it seemed like it should be?   The humor here falls incredibly short, and i was wondering if anyone else in the theater was not really shocked by these predictable plot twists.   it also looks like joel just watched an amazing movie directed by vincent gallo, and thought to himself ""man, whatta sweet filter he put on that camera, i gotta do something like that!""   I think the way this movie ends was an attempt to make some kind of statement about justice and how it can be sevrved in other ways than what we should expect, but it turns out to be pretty pointless when you think about it, even just for a second.  go see rushmore a fifth or sixth time, skip this fluke."	1
 Quite possibly the worst this year.	What a lousy movie.  Nick Cage delivers a dull performance as he runs around the country searching for the killers of a girl he never met.  Very predictable outcome.  The movie should have ended before it started.	1
 A movie not worth making	I have seen a lot of movies in my 74 years of life and I think this is, by far, one of the worst. It went on and on as if the writer and director could not bring themselves to let go of the sleaze and violence. Nick Cage's expression in most scenes was one of worried puzzlement which is the best he can do, I am afraid. I saw no redeeming features whatsoever.	1
 Disturbing movie - should have been X rated	This movie is intense, to say the least.  It is a rather disturbing psychological thriller, in which we see Nick Cage change from being a family man, nice guy to being an avenging angel.  The sleaze portrayed in the movie is necessary to show what he is working with, but folks, this movie is NOT fit for kids to see - period.  Hell, I'm 50 years old and I'm not sure I'm old enough to see it.In addition, Nick Cage only plays one character in all his movies.  It takes him a while to get into his character at the beginning and it does drag.  In addition, there are some scenes that just totally suck.  Bad writing, bad acting.  All in all, it wasn't worth the admission fee.  Give this one a miss.	3
 Critics are always right....	I usually read the reviews of different critics before I go see a movie.  On the wall it was written 2 words : ''Don't bother!'', I went to see it anyway.  Well folks, always listen to movie critics (some of them), this movie is a total mess and Nick Cage got paid 20 million for that????.  The movie started pretty good with a PI aka N. Cage going after the truth about a murder in a snuff flick, the turning point where the movie turned from bad to worse when all the main characters meet in an abandoned warehouse, if you saw it : I' m talking about the crossbow, chained to a bed, looking for a gun on the wrong side of car. At this particular point, I knew that Joel Schumacher disrespected the audience.  The only good stuff coming out of this movie is Joaquin Phoenix.  Oh yes, the endword : Bad ripoff from ''Se7en''.	1
 Terrible	Terrible acting on all levels.  This movie isn't even worth the  film it was recorded.  The film's attempt to be a dark portrayal of the underground world of pornography is laughable from the opening lines of the script. Save your 8 dollars.	1
 What's the point ?	I felt physically sick for one whole day after seeing 8MM. This film is about a subject nobody wants to hear about, and it made me feel ashamed of being a human being. How can humans do such things as raping and murdering young teenagers, children, and even babies I do not understand. This film is about all this, and I can only strongly recommend that you don't go and see it, despite the very good performance of Nicolas Cage, excellent as always. After this film I think it is time for everybody to ask themselves if there is any point in showing in films the kind of horrors displayed for two hours in 8MM. What's the point of cinema? If you think it is to raise emotions of shame and disgust, them 8MM is for you. I don't think 8MM should ever have been made.	1
 With this director it was going to be hard	"I agree with the majority of the critics here. This movie could've been great, but the director is just horrible. A dark story treated and resolved with the complexity of a Disney movie. The score tells you how to feel everytime instead of trusting the awful material. An alarming lack of subtlety to make sure we all understand everything. And even if the narrative and story is more or less acceptable going into the third act, its the conclusion of the story that makes the whole movie retroactively bad. When you watch this third act, you can understand why Batman & Robin were as bad as they are. Its a big: ""Oh, THAT'S WHY!"".What a waste. Nicholas Cage was fine, actually."	3
 Too Slow, but not Boring	Never saw this film in 1999 and was eager to see Nicolas Cage in his earlier films. Having now viewed it, I am not disappointed but for 2018, the slow and painstaking buildup in getting to the truth doesn't work anymore. Life is too rushed nowadays and would be found a boring drawback and cheesy movie.I can't say I liked it, but am pleased to have seen it. This 2 hour movie gets my watchable rating of 6. The last half hour of the movie made it work for me.	6
 Kind of Disappointing..	A surveillance specialist Tom Welles down an increasingly dark and frightening path. With the help of streetwise Max, Welles relentlessly follows a bizarre trail of evidence to determine the fate of a complete stranger. As his work turns into obsession, he drifts farther away from his wife, family and simple life as a small-town private eye. 8MM is a bit way too disturbing at times than it should be but also a bit way too much on the sex and kinky side of things rather than building a well structured thriller with well written characters and a storyline too. (5/10)	5
 Boring	Classic N. Cage's acting that makes you root for the villains.If you are looking for nothing else than the obvious clichè or a not challenging movie to watch while you're doing something else you've come to the right place. Once you've watched the first hour you easily can guess the rest of it.I also recommend this movie to people who suffer heart problems... you don't have much to worry about as no suspense or unexpected twists occur.	5
 Good.Brutal,Interesting. We all have morbid curiosity	The violence was brutal but nothing too crazy. I enjoyed the story but the plot twists were not too predictable.. Nicholas Cage was good surprisingly I think he gave weight to the character I found it hard to believe he was angry sometimes. James as one of the villains was awesome The direction was nice Writing was pretty good. They way the shots moved from location to location gave a sense of suspense. I enjoyed the characters within the film. Could have been a bit more seedy though I wanted to see the rabbit hole go a bit deeper .Supporting actors were strong. I thought that this film was going to be a bit more graphic. If you want something like this but more insane go for A Serbian Film.. I like the music so yeah 6/10.	6
 Not my Official Review - But a statement	"This is not a review at this time but a clear and unwavering - ""DON'T YOU DARE REMAKE THIS FILM"" - Sickening to think that this would be touched at all.How dare you.This is not a review at this time but a clear and unwavering - ""DON'T YOU DARE REMAKE THIS FILM"" - Sickening to think that this would be touched at all.This is not a review at this time but a clear and unwavering - ""DON'T YOU DARE REMAKE THIS FILM"" - Sickening to think that this would be touched at all.This is not a review at this time but a clear and unwavering - ""DON'T YOU DARE REMAKE THIS FILM"" - Sickening to think that this would be touched at all."	8
 Underrated thriller with distasteful subject matter	Joel Schumacher may have bombed out with the atrociously-received BATMAN AND ROBIN, but his latest thriller is a complex, thrilling movie which gives us a detailed character breakdown of the hero, who himself is partially seduced by the dark side and not altogether good. It's not often we get psychological insights like this in mainstream movies, but Nicolas Cage is able to pull the role off, and still come out on top as a likable figure.The movie starts out well, depicting the classy side of the obscene, before gradually moving into murkier and murkier depths, eventually leading to a conclusion where Cage commits acts just as bad as the people he's after. Cage is fast becoming one of my favourite actors of recent years, and he once again excels himself. A solid cast is built around him, including an intelligent, likable sidekick with Joaquin Phoenix, an up-and-coming star, and also the actress playing his wife, who portrays her mental suffering excellently. In fact, there isn't a bad performance in the whole film, from the grief-stricken good guys to the drugged up bad guys, who simply have no compassion and no regrets about what they do: it doesn't even bother them.The subject matter was enough to put a lot of people off this film, but it really isn't that bad, apart from quite a few sexual situations, this is nothing worse than what you'd see late night on Channel 5. The most disturbing thing of all is the actual snuff film itself, especially the drugged, dozy eyes of the young victim as she gets butchered to death. This is pretty hard to take, especially when we learn how she was just a normal girl, who got seduced by promises of a career in the movie industry. This is pretty close to reality and it could happen, which is why it's all the more disturbing. When we meet the bad guys in the final half of the film, it's not that bad as they're just like you and me, making money.This is perhaps over-emphasised at the end of the film, with the unmasking of the central character Machine, who acts as an executioner in the snuff film. He turns out to be just a normal, overweight man with glasses; there's nothing strange about this man who could be a friend, or neighbour. On the outside he's perfectly normal. On the inside, he's a twisted pervert. Much of the violence is kept off screen, except at the end where Cage goes around bringing much-deserved vengeance to all the scum and sickos involved.8MM turns out to be an intelligent, thoughtful look at one man's obsession and the depths to which the human race will sink. It's got it's fair share of flaws, but these have unfairly meant that it's got something of a bad reputation, probably from cinema goers hoping for the CGI effects or explosions of the latest blockbuster, or for something really profound. It's underrated, and surprisingly good.	6
 It's a movie about sleazy things, not a sleazy movie.		6
 A good thriller. Nothing too special about it.		7
 Brilliant Sadeian Thriller!		9
 Only 8 MM till truth, as well as till death ...		9
 Superb film that's kinda ruined by a plot flaw that jumps way past the suspension of disbelief		
 Otherwise Mediocre Film that Causes Violently Enjoyable Dreams	"Pretty suspenseful film that takes you on a thorough tour of the illegal and semi-legal hardcore pornography industries. Much of the acting, Cage's in particular, is not that great, and the whole mood of the film is quite grim and virtually humorless. I wasn't going to bother reviewing this one because there isn't a lot else to say about it. Except this: The night after I watched ""8MM,"" I had a long succession of ultra-violent but intriguing and ultimately entertaining dreams. I don't remember the specifics very well, but the atmospheres and plot-lines were, understandably, I suppose, quite similar to this film. I watch a lot of films of this type, but few affect my sub-c in quite this manner. So, if you're like me and occasionally enjoy intense and frightening dreams, I strongly recommend watching ""8MM"" sometime before retiring for the night!"	7
 There is a Case for Watching or Not Watching This Disturbing Film		7
 Pretty Good	"Nicolas Cage plays a ""surveillance specialist"" hired to determine whether a snuff film found in the safe of a recently deceased Pennsylvania millionaire is authentic—a job that leads him into the seamier recesses of the porn industry on both coasts. The director of this creepy wide-screen thriller is Joel Schumacher, who will surely live in infamy for Batman and Robin; he seems much more in charge this time, maybe because he has something to work with. The sturdy script is by Andrew Kevin Walker, the former Tower Records cashier who also wrote Seven, and there's a similar impulse here to rub our noses in terminal slime and evil. The desire for retribution that's honored so unambiguously may be morally based, but it's the morality of Mickey Spillane, and I wonder if the defense of vigilante justice in Schumacher's earlier A Time to Kill is more than just a coincidence. I can't say I warmed to the results, but I was solidly held for the film's two hours, and the secondary cast—including Joaquin Phoenix, Peter Stormare, Amy Morton, and James Gandolfini—is unusually sharp; with Catherine Keener, Anthony Heald, and Chris Bauer."	7
 A little too realistic		6
 Cage	up until this movie I didn't even know what a snuff film was. well this movie sure did open my eyes,, this movie I believe should have had an X rating because of the highly controversial material. i'm a huge Nicolas Cage fan,, having acting seen him film a movie at my job once at the Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City. so he plays a detective who is hired by this old lady, she found something disturbing in her late husband's possessions and she don't know what it is so she asks him to investigate, he makes a promise to her that he now wishes he probably didn't , but he pursues thing,, he takes on a partner so to speak in helping him figure out the seedy underworld of snuff films.. Joaquin Phonenix who does a pretty good job in the film.. all in all some parts of the movie are extremely hard to watch,, but if you can get past all of that, then it's worth a watch,, I've seen it twice,, and I liked it better the second time round.	6
" A non-audacious ""Seven"""		
 A Great Film.		9
 Nick Cage At His Finest	Just watched 8MM for about the 6th. time and felt compelled to add a review.I like Nicholas Cage,but most of his movies are far from comparable to 8 MM........this movie is Cage at his best,with an awesome supporting cast.Totally underrated and gritty film ,very disturbing and at the same time,very touching in certain parts.Cage,Gandolfini,and Phoenix are at the top of their respective games in this one.A classic in my opinion and IMDb rating is definitely misleading and should be much higher.A seedy,gritty,dirty,sleazy,and touching in parts,edge of your seat suspense filled classic!	
 What DID you expect?	"Almost universally lambasted upon release for all the wrong reasons time continues to be kind to 8mm, a film which will surely remain the pinnacle of Joel Schumachers checkered directing career. The movie explores the darkest side of the human soul as Nicholas Cages private detective is hired to find a missing girl who appears to have been murdered in a snuff movie. Schumacher never found favour with the critics even at his peak when his output was as erratic as most other even revered directors. Some expected Seven part 2 as it was scripted by Andrew Kevin Walker.Sorry its not a serial killer movie. Others moaned that it failed to explore the real underbelly of pornography/snuff movies. What i say to that is this is a movie not an investigative documentary.Cage under performs beautifully here. None of the bug eyed histrionics which have blighted so many of his performances. Even when he finally explodes into a rage by beating to death James Gandolfinis character it comes across as entirely believable The supporting cast are also excellent. Joaquin Phoenix plays the only other sympathetic male who tags along with Cage. The rest are a rum bunch of sleaze bags and villains. Peter Stomare hams it up magnificently as the porn mogul and Anthony Heald excels as the sleazy lawyer.My only complaint with the story are in some of the all too convenient plot contrivances which assist Cage in tracking down the location of the missing girl.Schumacher successfully ratchets up the tension in both the scenes where Cage escapes from captivity in the warehouse and at the end when he tracks down ""Machine"", the final remaining member of the snuff movie crew. When Machine is finally literally unmasked he asks Cage ""what did you expect?"" A question as pertinent to the detractors of this masterpiece."	10
 Excellent Thriller that Everybody should see	This review may contain what some consider spoilers. 8MM is one of those amazing films that time seems to have forgotten about(quite unfairly if you ask me). In the film Nic Cage plays Tom Welles, a private detective, who has been called in by the widow of millionaire to determine whether or not a snuff film found in her husband's belongings is authentic. Welles investigates the case as if it were a missing person's case. The case brings Welles deep into the world of underground pornography. James Gandolfini does a fantastic job playing the head of the distribution company that released the film. Cage does a great job playing a subdued investigator who starts to slowly question his own morals as he gets deeper in the case. Joaquin Phoenix plays Max California,a clerk at a local porn shop, so convincingly that I actually forgot that it was Joaquin Phoenix in the role. Character actor Peter Stormare plays one of the most subtly intimidating villains in a thriller. This is one movie that should appeal to everybody. Even those who aren't usually into thrillers should be able to find some entertainment in this movie.	10
 Torture & Murder In 8MM	Joel Schumacher has quite the reputation of being a director that dumbs down films with melodrama or by stripping the script off any depth. '8MM' is quite an intense chilling thriller that does touch on some very disturbing themes. However, Schumacher doesn't delve into it enough. He's more focused on the mystery of the missing girl angle. This could have been a though provoking film but the director seems to be too concerned with the Hollywood aspect. The film does make brief suggestions about the power and influence pornography has on people but it doesn't explore the psyche that draws people towards it. That said, '8MM' is a decent thriller. It had me engaged from the very beginning. Moreover the solid execution, especially the camera-work, art direction and the haunting score create an intense atmosphere. For a Hollywood flick, '8MM' is quite graphic. Nicolas Cage is brilliant and so is Joaquin Phoenix. James Gandolfini is a scene stealer as the sleazy pornographer. Catherine Keener isn't given much to do other than playing the concerned wife. Overall, it's a decent flick which could have been more than that if it was in the hands of a more capable director.	
 Unsettling but worth watching...once.	"I am a fan of psychological thrillers, so when I discovered ""8mm"" was available on Netflix instant stream, I figured I'd go ahead and give it a shot.I think it's important to mention this movie was written by the same guy who wrote the movie ""Se7en"", in other words, if you're expecting something light and fluffy, you're in for a rude awakening. This movie is ultra dark and unsettling yet oddly intriguing.I wouldn't feel comfortable saying I ""liked"" this movie, I think that'd be kind of messed up to say you liked something like this, but I will say that I was drawn into the story and was genuinely concerned what happened to Nicolas Cage's character.I would recommend this movie to others, but I think one viewing is more than enough. This movie isn't for the faint-of-heart, know that going in."	7
 Geeky Randy's summary		6
 More Hollywood garbage	I like all sorts of movies, but I like foreign films and Independent films the best. Hollywood has a way of sticking big directors and big stars on a film and promoting the hell out of it and making people watch it and therefore it gets popular when in reality it shouldn't be. This is a good case.One might find interest in this if they didn't know that such a world existed, but it is very real and it's old news. If this had been a movie with insight into the minds of people who do this kind of stuff, I would have enjoyed it.It is about a private investigator (played by the very boring Nicolas Cage) who is hired to find out if a snuff film is real and if so who made it. He goes on a search into the dark underground world of porn and looks for his answers and meets many bad characters along the way.This thriller just bored me, it needed to shock the audience and show them violent torture, yet its just the idea and the awareness of it is all you receive. I didn't care about anyone on this film, I did not know the young girl in question, the film gave her no soul or no character and I didn't feel sorry for her. Her mother's tears didn't make me sad, if it had been a loving home this would not have happened anyway, so too late for tears now Mommy dearest. The old woman who hired Cage in the first place was the only person I felt sorry for, she was great, and made me care for her.Shumacher sucks as a director and never does anything outstanding to me, he has no unique style and I can't believe so many people like him. Cage is so over the top and funny to watch, he sucks so bad yet he too has fans. James Gandolfini is a great actor and plays one of the bad guys here, can't ask for anyone better as well as Peter Stormare, he was born to play a villain. Anthony Heald is in here and even if he played Santa Claus in a movie he still comes off with an evil vibe. Joaquin Phoenix plays a punk here and I have no problem with him, I think he done an excellent job here.Thrills, there are few, shocking moments are even less. The movie has disturbing images for those who are bothered by such things, but it has no torture or anything so its okay for the squeamish to watch.I think of it as drama, what I see is a movie about a man obsessed with his job and making his own family suffer because of it, to me his wife is hurting more than the girl in the snuff film, the girl in the snuff film is running away from something and got lost along the way, Cages wife in this movie is running towards something but being pushed away..to me thats sad.I don't know what to say other than if you like boring drama's with a touch of excitement this may be for you.	3
 You have got to love the cheap DVD bin!	I came across this in my local video store's pre-viewed bin by chance. It seemed to me that the last time I saw 8mm was in the theater when it first came out. For some reason I seemed to remember liking this movie, the DVD was anamorphic widescreen and the price was right so I picked it up. I watched it about a week after purchasing it and was not disappointed. This movie although very dark is quite worth watching especially if your a Nicolas Cage fan. However if you are easily offended do yourself a favor and do not watch this movie as it is very intense and potentially offensive to some at various times. This movie is a good mix of drama and action and is very thought provoking. Just about anybody who views this movie will be effected in one way or another, likely not in a negative way but in fact in an eye-opening way.

 Embarrassingly bad	After watching '8 millimeters', I have a question. Why was this film made? I don't know movies, only words, so when I see words so badly used, it makes me sad. And when a good idea and good actors can't find even mediocre talent for the script or direction, my sadness is like a funeral in the rain. For poor Nick Cage, a good actor, getting mixed up in this whirlpool of weary words was a classic mistake. Why don't agents protect their actors from these talent-free zones? Surely any professional reading of this grotesque script must have revealed way in advance how badly things would turn out ... or was the paycheck simply too enormous to knock back? I'd really like to know who backed these two hours of lost time. Perhaps there's something I'm missing - like was it designed to be bad, lose money and reduce studio taxation? Hollywood does this, and it genuinely mystifies me. All I could ask myself as this thing built to its inevitably Gothic climax was ... with loads of fine writing and directing talent available ...why this?	2
 Don't waste your time	"With successful hits such as ""Face/Off"" and ""Con Air"" behind him, Nicolas Cage ventured out in one of the worst films of 1999. ""8MM"" is so awful it doesn't even deserve to be in video stores.""8MM"" surrounds Cage's portrayal of a private investigator named Tom Welles, who becomes involved in a missing persons case. A missing persons case that leads Welles into a disturbing world that includes pornography.There are only a few scenes in this film that make the film just short of a total waste of money. They include scenes of mystery and those that make you wonder what is going on, and with his family.Nicolas Cage is a very smart and brilliant action star; however, he must have let it slip his mind because if he had bothered to go over the script with a magnifying glass he would have found that it was flawed.""8MM"" deserves a spot in the hall of shame."	
 Disappointment	This 1999 Nicholas Cage vehicle started out as a decent thriller, but turned out to be just another b-movie. I got a feeling, watching this movie, there actually was a good enough script, but Schumacher couldn't quite handle it as well as he did the much simpler Phone Booth. The subject of snuff movies is as scary as it is a grateful one for any screenplay writer. As for the acting, Cage himself could easily have been replaced by, say, Jon Bon Jovi or John Travolta. That should give you a clue about the effort he put in to portraying his character. This movie, a big disappointment, could have been so much better and more interesting had the script been handed over to someone like Abel Farrara or David Lynch.	3
 Strange	"A strictly taboo topic rarely covered in films, 8mm touched on the very dark recesses of human nature. Schumacher did well to handle such a unpleasant topic, keeping the violence to a minimum. The haunting, almost bhangra score, a well timed performance by Joaquin Phoenix, and the seedy appearance of James Gandolfini add to the film. However there are two aspects of the film which badly let it down. Firstly Nic Cage as the lead, not bad but certainly not thought provoking enough. For those who have seen the film imagine a Morgan Freeman or Gary Sinise in the lead. The second and major downfall is the last third of the film. We are introduced to Peter Storemare's ludicrous director, the obvious ""the lawyer was in on it"" plot and a typical Hollywood ending. For a film not really aimed at your average cinema goer, the ending seems to want to please the masses and therefore gives the film an uneven finish. Unlike Seven (writer Andrew Kevin Walker wrote both) 8mm wanted everything to finish with the ""bad guys are dead everythings going to work out routine"" when really the gritty film needed a gritty ending."	
 8MM of trash	"With successful hits such as ""Face/Off"" and ""Con Air"" behind him, Nicolas Cage ventures out in one of the worst films of 1999.

 What ppl dont see	Well , i see this movie gets really hard reviews - and i really disagree with it. first of all i really like the character cage plays , its a great character that really makes you enter the story and find hope in it. joel did a great job with this movie making u feel scared ALL the time , it's never happy , always sad and bleak weather and ppl. makes u understand the horrible truth behind the porn world and what the girls go through.for the gross stuff , i suggest ppl that cant handle some violence to keep watching disney movies.	
 A real view at life	8MM is just a movie with a real-time view of the current world. It's just a subject wich is not really loved by the audience because it is the truth. Nicolas Cage is just Tom Welles, he plays like it happened it himself. The real view of life in the porn-bussiness is just viewed that good, you're really live along Tom Welles and all the others.	
 8ZZzzzzzzz	Nicolas Cage is an annoying actor with the same predictable roles in every movie he's cast in. He's a good actor, I know but I don't like him.  Nic Cage is an investigator searching for a missing girl who disappeared from home and was seen in a violent porno film owned by some old bastard. Anyway, being an investigator, you think Nic Cage wouldn't become so attached to people, but he does and blows the whole case out of proportion. Once the movie is over all you can do is think - why??? The movie was too long and the action scenes weren't actiony enough for me. They were more gory than anything else. I suppose most people who like 90s films will like this, but most people who like good films won't.	
 Average but overly long thriller (with disturbing subject matter)		5
 How many ways can you say terrible?	I watched this sad movie on pay per view with a friend. Since we paid to watch it, we continued to sit through this piece of crap in hopes that it would somehow redeem itself. How can this movie be worse? That it continues on and on when there were several times to put it out of its misery. In one scene, Cage's character actually runs away from the bad guys that he has severly beaten down and could have ended it all right there. Needless to say, don't waste your time on this movie. My friend and I actually called DirecTV for our money back, because it was so bad. Unfortunately, they don't guarantee a good movie, only that we will receive the movie in good quality reception and sound.	
 Why?	This film was a major disappointment and I can't help wondering why it got made.The scriptwriter gave us a ridiculous premise, ridiculous characters and failed to incorporate any gripping twists. The director couldn't seem to make his mind up whether he wanted to be realistic or impressionistic. The lead actor wandered like a zombie through the movie from scene to sleazy scene.At the end of it all I'm sadly none the wiser.	3
 unfortunate	just thought i'd comment cos there is a lot of negativity. First off, andy k walker got screwed on this one by schumacher. Fincher would have done a lot better, i am sure. As it stands, Nic Cage is ok and, as with many films, Joaquin Phoenix portrays an excellent character in his inimitable style.Schumacher has done a lot of great work, but I think this wil be easily forgotten. Shame though, still worth a watch.6/10	
 What's the purpose?	"Not only the maincharactor's empty looks and bad drama was enough, but I wonder what was the message of the people who created this movie.Simply, I can't find any. The evil are evil and sick as what, but even the main character isn't good. I suppose the creators wanted to say that everyone, even a good man have a little of bad inside, but then the end of the movie leaves such stupid feeling.. Glad that I didn't pay for going to watch this to cinema. The movie starts with such an interesting setup. But in the middle and towards the end, movie loses it's elements and becomes meaningless revenge and killing. What gives the movie it's final ""touch"" is stupid and amateurish drama that gives ""acceptance"" for all that revenge and killing.I rarely see such a poor movie, even in these Hollywood stuff. Goes to the same box with ""Pearl Harbor"". Yes, definably so."	3
 Falls apart midway	I thought 8mm had a great first half.  *SPOILER WARNING* As i watched nic cage venture into the seedy underworld of porn, I felt disgusted at the depravity that exists in this world.  But,after the death of Max, the story just turns into another run of the mill thriller, with nic cage going after the usual bad guys. Again I think Joquin Phoenix did a great job,much better than the moping attitude nic cage had in the film.  I just wished the second half had been as interesting as the first half.  Maybe a director like David Fincher could have elevated the script to another level.	8
 Skip this one	"Saw this movie today and while Nicolas Cage's acting was terrific, as always, this movie left A LOT to be desired.  In fact, the ""action"" (actually, lack thereof) was so slow, I fell asleep in less than an hour. Woke up for about the last 30 minutes to find I really hadn't missed anything.  The plot needs a lot of work up---good premise, but that's as far as it went. The background ""music"" was lousy, as was the photography.  So, Nicolas.....I love you dearly, but wish I'd have skipped this one.  I wish you had as well...you're far better in movies such as ""The Rock""."	
 Good movie, but could have been much better.	Hi, I have never posted a review here but I couldn't resist after reading the reviews of others on this site so here goes.... I saw this movie last night and the way the clerk said that the movie had some shocking scenes of hardcore underground pornography in it made me think I was in for a shocking movie.  I guess for a more or less mainstream movie, but compared to the  films of David Lynch or David Cronenberg this was just your average detective movie with revenge undertones.I found Nicolas Cage to be back in good shape in this movie since lately he had been doing action movies (con air, face off..).  Anyway his performance was excellent and it's good to see he still does controversial movies. Joaquin Phoenix surprised me since his character is the best in the movie. I didn't hate anything really in this movie but I just got the sense that it wasn't showing you much the same way seven had this hype around it that it was really gory and shocking when I thought it was good, but far from shocking. All in all it is good but not shocking.  If you want to be shocked just go to a slaughterhouse, that is truly shocking. This movie just shows the dark side of humanity. anarchus	
 Ridiculous, at the best...	Oh Gosh! What a waste of time! I never thought Nicolas Cage could be a bad actor. In this movie, he is, even more, he is ridiculous. This is the kind of movie that can be attractive to teenagers, excited by the S&M perspective. But I bet any adult used to real good movies will find it predictable and very boring. As for Stormare'nails.... bad copy od Nosferatu or Oldman in Bram Stoker's Dracula. When I laugh in a supposed very serious movie, it is a bad sign!!! If you're sixteen and h...., go see it, otherwise, stick with 'Seven'.	4
 Good flick, but moves too slowly	It's a great movie as a whole, but the first half or so didn't do justice to the previews.  Going in, I was expecting something a bit more action packed, but it didn't deliver until the end.  All in all, see it, but go to the matinee.  It's not worth the full price.	
 Creepy attempt at a disturbing story.	"I paid matinee money for this 35mm movie about an 8mm film. 5 bucks. Thank god. A penny more and I'd be pretty upset.I think that given a good enough script and direction, Nicholas Cage can be one hell of an actor. Yet, right from 8mm's beginning, Cage's portrayal of a Husband/Father who has everything he could possibly want seems forced and completely without authenticity. You know who would've been great in this role?  Roberto Benigni... I think he would've been as little more believable. The story is intriguing...but a good 15-20 minutes could've been hacked off this thing, including the crappy ending...There was really no need for unmasking ""Machine"".. Why put a face on evil? Geez- I cannot imagine paying $9.50  (Manhattan price) for this dud of a flick or recommending a friend to do the same."	6
 Unrealized Potential	"I went into this film with very high expectations (based on the press it has been getting and the writer), however I was depressed by how flat and lifeless the movie was.  The storyline has potential to be a wonderful psychological thriller, but falls short in the presentation.  While I happen to like Cage in most films, he does not fulfill the role well.  The biggest problem that I can see with this film is that there is no connection to the characters.  Unlike ""Usual Suspects"" or ""Apt Pupil"" where the connection to the characters draws you into the film and makes you relate to them (even in some demented way), this film leaves you caring nothing for anyone involved. There is no real development of the ""villain"" characters in this film, in fact you do not even meet them till the last 20 minutes or so.  Visually the movie is well shot, but the editing is lacking some dynamics that would have improved the feel. My general impression is that the creators are trying to shock people more then develop the plot, and unless you are easily shocked, it will not work. Overall, don't waste the 7 bux to see this in the theaters, rent it if you want to see it."	4
 Allright.. but it's NOT as good as it looks	"Schumacher usually does a damn good job at doing movies (Falling Down)... in this though.. the problem was the actual writing.  The trailers make the movie seem like another Seven or The Game.. which is what I expected it to be like.  This movie was entertaining and very dramatic at parts, which was cool.  Also, Cage is an incredible actor.. but the whole movie left him silent and distant.. a person usually gets attached to his character early, but some of his lines in this seemed tacked on.. no, not like those catch lines from Terminator or Batman.. but it just seems every once in awhile he'll just say something completely out of line.  I liked the conclusion, although it wasn't shocking like many expected it to be.  On the Skatt rating I give it a 6.5.  One thumb up... if you're bored and not ""squeamish"" go out and see it.. but don't get all worked up if you haven't seen it yet.. it's not THAT good."	6
 Intensely disturbing, morally repulsive, great cinematography, but cliched		8
 A flatly acted disturbing film.	This film is aptly named. It has all the qualities of an 8mm film that you would see in a garage behind someone's house. I would not have minded all the disturbing images if there was a story to go with them. The movie was flatly acted and you really couldn't expect anything else from such a thin plot. The person in the movie that you should care about, (the victim) is never fleshed out enough for you to care if Cage's character gets the bad guys or not. I would not recommend this movie for either the theater or rental.	2
 A terrible mess of an action/thriller mixed with drama	8MM explores the underground of pornography and the violence that is associated with sex.  The film had one major plot -- Cage's attempt to discover the origins of a film that he as been hired to investigate.  The film has many interesting subplots which are never fully developed. This is the worst Nicolas Cage film I have ever seen.  He looked confused most of the movie, like he was not really sure what to do in the way of acting, so he just gives the blank stare, that is very misplaced. Basically the film is a pile of interesting potential, but totally flopped in all areas of the Big Screen. Don't waste your time to see it.	2
" Positive comments on the dark film ""8 mm"""	Great cinematography, great screenplay from the writer of `Seven' Nicholas Cage proves that his Oscar was not a fluke. I also liked `Fargos' Peter Stodmaire, who plays a sleazy s&m producer. I liked the moody lighting, it added to the effect of this dark tale. The subject matter was outrageous by typical `R' standards, but I figure if the movie works then the content doesn't matter. Maybe a more moody director should have been chosen like David Fincher (Seven, The Game), or Alex Proyas (Dark City, The Crow), rather than Batman And Robin director Joel Schumacher. Still a solid thriller, go see it.	8
 Very disappointed in this movie.	"I thought this would be a breakthrough movie for Nicolas Cage, the kind of movie that would put him in demand in Hollywood. I was wrong, this movie was too long for its content. It may have been a good 90 minute movie but it was, at best, a mediocre 2 hour movie. The story and plot duration seemed to drag on for years, even though the duration of the story was to have taken place in a couple weeks. The music that was chosen to accompany many scenes was very distracting, it was a cross between ""alternative"" and ""snake charming music"".Cage is a private detective in the movie with a wife and child. He phones his wife almost every day while on assignment. The phone calls become very painful to watch. The wife complains the whole time that Cage is gone too long or she whines about his job. It's almost as if she doesn't know he is a private detective. The first scene of the movie has no place in the movie it is a complete waste of film. Cage also has a chance to wrap everything up in a warehouse scene but runs away and drags the story ending with him. I found myself listening to the conversations that were taking place in the theatre, rather than watching all of the movie. I would not recommend this movie, wait for the video if you must see it."	
 Could have been better	The idea was very good, the script was not too bad but... It really could have been better. This movie is very dark and sordid but it doesn't catch you. You don't really have feelings for the characters and it becomes too unbelievable at a certain point.It wasn't a bad movie but, you can't stop imagining what Oliver Stone or Quentin Tarantino would have done with it.	5
 Surprisingly dull for what it had to work with!		4
 No thrills or surprises...	I would advise people to see something else before this one.  I went to go see it because people said it had twists right up to the last frame, well, THIS ISN'T TRUE!  There is one twist, and both Cage's character and the audience don't care. I will give Schumacher credit for effectively creating the intense dark mood, and it is much better than his other recent disasters. Finally, unless your really squeamish, the content shouldn't bother anyone too much, it's not as bad as people say.	5
 commercials lie	don't believe the hype about the movie.  despite the advertising's claims (implicit or explicit), this movie has none of the graphic, disturbing imagery of _Seven_. instead of being shocking, the movie's attempts at exhibiting the perversity of the porn world were stereotypical and laughable.  although Cage and Phoenix deliver some convincing acting, the movie is disappointing.  if you're expecting a gritty film with some substance, skip this one.  if not, simply sit back, turn off your brain, and enjoy yourself.	
 Not where is it going, but why?	What a waste of talent!  Knowing that I was in for an evening of the seamy side of life, I was willing to accept that for I knew that Cage would not have ventured into this film without good reason.  I'm, still trying to figure out what that reason was.  The film goes nowhere!  I'm not sure why it left the dock in the first place.  I suppose there are those who want to know more about the pornographic side of life, but even they will be disappointed.  There's not much for anyone.  Strike it off as a wasted two hours!	3
 This movie made me sick.		1
 Good Movie, Bad Ending		
 A disappointment	8mm showed unlimited amounts of promise- a script penned by the writer of Se7en and Sleepy Hollow, a well-balanced cast of newcomers (Joaquin Phoenix) and established actors (Nicolas Cage, James Gandolfini) and a controversial subject matter.  What we ended up with was a pompous, self-righteous semi-thriller which seemed to deliberately shock and shamelessly imitate thrillers such as Se7en and The Silence of the Lambs.  However, 8mm is nowhere near as accomplished as those films.First of all, the once suitable ending was completely changed to suit Hollywood's hero-loving standards. **SPOILER** In the original script, Tom (Cage) committed suicide by driving head-on into a wall.  That seems more of a suitable ending than his mumbling nonchalance and the shedding of an occasional tear.  The cinematography is very difficult to watch- the lighting is far too low-key, even if this is intentional to fit in with the 'shocking' subject matter.  The soundtrack often overrides the dialogue, which isn't that hard considering that Nicolas Cage is only coherent for about 30% of the film.Joel Schumacer's directing is far too heavy handed, so much so that you can practically hear the grunts of exertion.  His direction lacks finesse, style, or any sense of tact, and this shows painfully in 8mm.  The pornography is overly explicit, tasteless, and the characters within the trade (Max California excluded) are nothing more than exaggerated caricatures.  The characters are boring (again, Max excluded- it seems that Phoenix carries the entire film on his shoulders, and is horribly underused), and we feel absolutely no sympathy for them.  The only sympathy we feel is for the people that paid good money to watch this film.	
 A Gripping Thriller	Ignore comments about this movie being lame in the end. I won't give the plot of the movie away (someone else already did that) but I will say this movie is a gripping thriller! It had me on the edge of my seat, especially the end. All the actors are all amazing, especially Nicolas Cage, and this is a great job of casting. This story could very well happen, if it hasn't already, which makes it that much more disturbing. I'm still trying to believe that Joel Schumacher directed this movie! He did a great job too. This movie was written by the same guy who wrote Se7en, so if you liked that movie, you will like this one also.	
 If you dabble in this fire you will get burned. Utter perversity... vile carnage of life.	C A R N A G EThe perversity...  the vile carnage of life.  utter evil is depicted in this movie.  2:30 in the morning tears in eyes, nauseated, I unplugged the VCR. Walking outside, and unable to fathom what would drive a human to violate oneself in such a manner I vehemently puked under an old oak tree.  I haven't finished the movie to this day.  I am scarred for life.  Do not take this statement lightly.Character Max made a comment about the content displayed herein.  He said that you can't dance with the devil because he won't change his tune... he will change you.How true.I plead with you to not watch this movie.	
 8mm was a very dark and disturbing movie that at times dragged, but overall made you think about the world that goes on when the lights go down.		5
 A load of crap	Seeing how a lot of people actually thought this movie was good, I have to disagree. I went to see this movie in the theater with some high expectations but came out feeling dumber. It is perhaps one of the most ridiculous movies and displays of over-acting I've ever seen. The one only true redeeming value of the movie was Jaoquin Phoenix's character, who of course HAD to be dealt with the way he was because if it was any other way the movie might have had a standing chance. He did it because he could? Grrreaaat plot point. I know Joel Schumacher has put out some pretty bad stuff (uhh all of his Batman takes) but this one was just ridiculous.	2
 Brutal & Derailed.		5
 Cage goes to Pornoland !	This movie was never going to dominate Oscar night. It is not as bad as some folks make it out to be. Then again, that is not to say it is great.This tale of Nick Cage's investigator exploring   the dark world of hardcore pornography probably plays better on video or satellite TV than on 35mm or 70mm at the movies. The story keeps up the interest until near the end when a moralising tone spoils it somewhat. Cage is great and carries the movie a great deal as he is virtually on screen the whole time. James Gandolfini and Joaquin ' The Actor Formerly Known As Leaf' Phoenix provide sound support. This one might make it as a cult movie in a few years from now. Worthwhile but not a masterpiece.	
 I expected more	What a good movie it could have been. The story is very impressive, but the script has been written very bad, dialogues are too cheap and fails in directing. I can't believe that Nicolas Cage could play so awful like this. He proved to the world that he's a very powerful actor by playing in Leaving Las Vegas. I expected more from him in 8mm. I don't suggest this movie.	3
 Good first half... (includes spoilers for the movie)	"I really liked the movie first of all... at last, I liked the first hour of it. The cinematography was excellent, the darkness and all that grey and black remembered me a lot of writer Andrew Kevin Walker`s other well-known work, ""Seven"". It just didn't rain as much as in ""Seven"". Nicholas Cage` search for the truth and the emotional change he goes through were very interesting to watch, thrilling. His scenes with the murdered girl`s mother were the best of the whole movie. The performance of Amy Morton as Jane Matthews especially stood out here. The movie gets very good the moment Cage's character, PI Tom Welles, teams up with Max California (Joaquin Phoenix), a clerk in a porn shop, Welles pays for helping him finding information in the s/m scene and the porn industry, a world completly alien to Welles himself.The two characters have a certain, very interesting way of dealing with each other, especially because Max turns out to be a totally different kind of person to what everyone would expect him to be at first. Max California turns out to even have a certain kind of innocence around him, something Welles has already lacked right from the beginning of the movie. But if you know at least a few Hollywood-made movies, it`s nearly needles to say that in a world supposed to be as bad as the one we see in ""8mm"", innocence can't survive. No surprise here, when still innocent and nice Max gets brutally murdered (while standing in front of a cross! Don't you dare to miss the deeper meaning here!) after half of the movie, just so Tom Welles can fulfill his descent into darkness. Oh please!At that moment, ""8mm"" turns into being just totally stupid. The first half of the movie, when everything was mostly about Welles, searching for the truth and Max helping him and both of them moving more and more into the darkness that is the porn industry in the eyes of He-who-killed-off-the-Batman-movies Joel Schumacher, everything was fine and very dark in a still fascinating way. That is, because we didn't have to see too much of the ridiculously stereotype bad guys who are supposed to give the darkness a real face. Here we have a movie, that COULD have been really scary if the bad guys would have been very normal and everyday guys. Instead, what see here are a bunch of bad guys who are that bad it wouldn't have made a difference if they'd have ""We are evil"" signs over their heads. And Super-Bad Guy ""Machine"" turns out to look like your friendly, four-eyed, living-with-his-mother kind of neighbour. Gasp! Wow, that's something totally new. I haven't actually seen that in a dozend other and better movies before and was therefore of course expecting Machine to have little horns and a tail. Oh please, again!What really made me frown was the end of the movie. I could accept somehow that Welles brutally killed off one of the bad guys and then burned the evidence of what he did. I could also accept him to go after Machine because it was just the natural thing to do for a hero in a Hollywood-movie. What I CAN`T accept about the end of the movie is, that Welles kills Machine in front of the man's house and then is able to just walk away without ANYONE asking any questions, without the murder on Machine or any other of the bad guys ever leading back to Welles. And it's not as if there wasn't any evidence. And what the hell happened to Max? Did Welles just leave him there in front of the cross, with his throat cut? Or did he actually call anyone to give his friend a decent burial?And then there's also the thing with the ""disturbing pictures"" a lot of people mentioned in their comments.  I can't say that I'm good in watching ""dark"" movies. They usually make me feel very uneasy and most of the time I have to close my eyes if there's too much blood involved. But no uneasiness here. All I could think all through the movie was, that Joel Schumacher was just using those pictures of death and nakedness (Gasp! Naked people. Please AGAIN!! We see ""worse"" than that in usual german TV at 10 pm). Most of the time they didn't seem to be a real part of the movie like in Seven, they were very often just meant to make people think ""Oh god. Look how sick some people are."" and to explain why Welles more and more turns into the dark and brooding hero who at last commits murders, too, at the end. And so I was grinning about those supposed-to-be disturbing pictures. I don't think that's what Schumacher intended.So what I think is: Good performance by Nicholas Cage, especially when fighting over if or if not to tell the mother of the murdered girl about what happened to her daughter. Good performance by Joaquin Pheonix. The character of Max could have turned out to be very dull, too, with the wrong actor. Thankfully, they had Pheonix. VERY good performance by Amy Morton. Good cinematography at the beginning of the movie. Ignore the bad guys and turn off the movie the moment Max dies, to spare yourself a few ridiculous fight and death scenes and some actions by the hero that just makes you think a big ""Huh??"". Then go and rent the spanish movie ""Tesis"" (english title: ""Thesis"") which deals with the subject of snuff movies, too, but unlike ""8mm"" actually IS disturbing and makes you think a lot about what people are capable of."	
 Slow, Lifeless, Lackluster		5
 C**p	Nicolas Cage has made some pretty bad movies in the past few years (Bringing Out The Dead being the only glaring exception that comes to mind), but none as bad as this boring, seedy dreck. Little wonder, it was directed by Joel Schumacher, who wouldn't know what to do with a little moment if it bit him on the ass and begged him for attention. If you must see a bad Nic Cage movie, there are plenty of other, better choices.	2
 A phenomenal waste of 2 hours.	Although this film blatantly aimed to shock the audience, I just found the whole thing to be distasteful.  Many times the movie just dragged painfully on- the film could have been edited to be 45 minutes shorter.  The ending was then rushed and disappointingly predictable.  What were supposed to be some of the most dramatic moments actually made the theater burst into laughter- they were that ludicrous.  Nicholas Cage's character was surprising static for all the hell he goes through, and towards the end of the movie it's hard to identify with most of his actions.  The only enjoyable part of this movie was Joaquin Phoenix's character, Max California.  It adds a bit of much needed levity to this otherwise ponderous film but falls just short of saving it from being an atrocious waste of time.	2
 The Unmoral Truth	This movie was very good, BUT!!! it made me sick!! This is not a movie for easily sickened people!!  I am not easily sickened but this movie was the sickest movie I ever SAW!  It was based on reality and the stuipidity of young youth to fall in the hands of something so evil.  Nicholas Cage did an exellent job in this movie!	6
 Dumb.	"***MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS***Didn't like this movie at all. Not because it shocked me, although it can get pretty disgusting sometimes (that's not a problem, i have a hard stomach), but because the way I see it that's the only thing the director tried to do with the film... shock people. When you're ""shocked"" once or twice in a movie that can be good, i like it; when the director tries to do this almost ALL the time things get boring, uninteresting and incredibly exaggerated. There's a long list of things about this movie that I find ridiculous, but I won't waste my time writing them down. I watched this  one on video, but if I were you I'd wait until it's on cable... not that bad for one of those nights were you have nothing else to do.4/10"	
 Lots of twist and turns, all of them predictable	"This movie wasted its potential.  The topic ""snuff"" films is one that peaked my interest.  However, as the movie progressed, I lost any interest I had. Nicolas Cage's character was VERY poorly developed.  This was one of the many problems I had with the film.  For the most part, this film was very effective at creating drama.  However, when the audience finally was able to look forward to some exciting conclusion we were let down.  This film is a rental at best.  At worst, it totally wasted the talents of Joaquin Phoenix and Nicolas Cage."	5
 A descent into a world of violent porn.		
 THIS ONE IS OFF THE MARK!	"The latest Joel Schumacher film ""8MM"" is about a private detective investigating a snuff film. It stars one of the best actors around- Nicolas Cage. Sounds good huh? Well, the bad news is that I have seen some amateur children's 8mm films that are better than this piece of junk. The movie goes nowhere! At one point, I was tempted to shoot my 32 mm into the projector so I could be spared.  I hope Nic goes back and does more movies that could really display his acting skills and does not get caged up into being an action hero. These and maybe another 8 unmentioned reasons are why you should not see ""8MM."" ** Needs Improvement"	4
 Comments here more disturbing than the film	"I taped the film Sunday night, and had to watch it in 3 times (due to time constraints).  I finished it this morning and immediately came here on IMDB.COM to see the comments.One comment disturbed me so much that I have to comment: One comment (didn't notice who) said that they couldn't understand why Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) got so emotionally involved.  Well, let me ask whoever asked that a question:  If he didn't who would???  The police sure as hell is not going to lift a finger on a 6 year-old case.  Welles is just giving revenge for someone who can't.  I mean, do you actually want people like that walking the streets??Welles and the mother weren't the only 2 people who cared for Mary Anne. How about the old lady?For people who said that this movie is NOT disturbing, I can't believe you! You probably laugh at the ""Faces of Death"" videos (which I have NO intention on seeing thank you very much).  Anyway, this movie is good for 1 view only for me.  I hate sad flicks.  Life is disturbing enough!SPOILER ****** SPOILER ****** SPOILER ****** SPOILER ******When I was watching the movie, I was kind of hoping that the wife wasn't there.  Then Welles could have started a new life with Mary Anne's mother....just a thought.  What do you think?"	
 My god, what a piece of junk		5
 George C. Scott did it better	"This movie was a poor excuse for the George C. Scott movie ""Hardcore"". Both films attempt to show the vile, seedy underbelly of man's depravity but this later day version gets lost in a weak script and a mailed in performance by Cage. Throughout the entire movie it's hard to decide what you hate more, Cage's constantly nagging wife who questions every action he does or does not do ad infinitum, or Cage's indecisive excuse of a detective who cringes at every possible excuse for cruelty but yet pummels a bad guy to death with his gun. The basic premise is the same however, child runs away, gets lost in the underworld of hardcore porn, and someone tries to find her by immersing themself in the porn world before she is killed. George C. Scott's performance runs rings around Cage. If this subject is a priority for you, who knows, go rent the movie ""Hardcore""."	
 8mm	*sorry for spelling mistakes* This movie is good but not the best in it's genre. I mean Nicholas Cage is very good in his role as Thomas Hart. But he isn't as good as he was in con air. Some Questions. 1.Why should he care about the girl in the ''snuff'' movie? 2.Why did he must get revenge on the ''bad-guys'', it wasn't his daughter? 3.He should only investigate and give the evidence to mrs christian(myra carter) The actors are great,the script is great because Andrew Kevin Walker(seven) has written it. But The plot is a minus to this movie,everything but the plot is great.I give it 4½ out of 10.	
 Two hours of my life I'll never get back		
 Why???	8MM, Snake Eyes, City of Angels...What is Cage thinking when he makes these movies. For a guy with talent he picks some pretty sad scripts. I rated 8MM a 4 (out of 10) only because I must be an idiot also. Here's to all the idiots in the world!!!	4
 Awful, just awful.	Whoever said that Nick Cage sleepwalked through this film was right on. He was so wooden he could have been mistaken for a tree. We don't know who he is, why he is taking this assignment, and frankly we really don't care! The premise was good... I liked the idea a lot and it seemed really interesting and creepy and underground and sleazy and all of that good stuff. But while the premise was great, the execution was excruciating. His relationship with his wife got tired after 5 minutes, his detective work was bizarre and very very lucky (he finds the girl's picture after - ONE day of looking? Who knows, we are not given any kind of time frame. He finds the diary in the toilet... what, the mother NEVER looked in the toilet tank for 6 years??? Did this toilet never run?) and his vengeance seemed misplaced. Why does he care so much? He wants to rid the world of all evil? I don't know... it was hard to follow, annoying... and the soundtrack! All over the map and WAY too loud. Avoid this film. Horrible.	
 8 MM = 0 I.Q.		3
 Seven it is not	I really rushed out to see this film the first day of its release. Why? Because the writer of 8 MM is the same person who wrote the BRILLIANT screen play for Se7en. Anybody who sees this film will be turned off by many things. It started out good, but went downhill real fast after the first half hour. The acting was so so at best. I would suggest you rent or see Se7en instead of 8 MM.	4
 Story doesn't support explicit scenes.	What really kills this movie is not the fact that the movie has explicit scenes, but that the plot is so week that all you get from this is the disturbing scenes.  If the movie did a better job of moving the plot along and making the story more interesting, it would justify the perverse scenes, and coming away you would be thinking of what happened in the movie, not the disturbing views you get here and there in the movie.  Instead you can almost predict what's going to happen next at every turn, and you become so bored with the story, that you could care less with what happens to the characters.  It's no wonder all you hear about is the terrible images in the movie, but not what the movie is actually about.	4
 Bleh	I didn't like this movie. Not one bit. The entire premise of it was... well... silly. I really doubt that the kind of films the antagonists were making exist. Further, I doubt that a private detective would get 'wrapped up' in a case this much. Also, the fact that there were *no* police in the film (despite 5 shootings, 3-4 people getting stabbed/sliced) made it almost comical. The whole thing was dark and looked like it was trying to be 'artsy'. Bah humbug. Where's the Nicolas Cage we saw in the Rock or Face/Off?	2
 If you've got time to burn, go ahead and sit through this stinker.	My god this thing drags along. Was this movie supposed to shock me? What is Cage doing in this film? He is so wrong for the part. Watching him is painful, especially the first time he sits down to view the snuff film. The expressions on his face were so contrived, I thought he was on the toilet. The repetitive sense between Cage and his wife really begin to grind on you as well. Especially after their tenth argument about the same thing. What is up with every thriller, suspense, shock, piece of crap movie coming out of Hollywood, having these endless fight to the death (but no, the psycho's not dead till you stab and shot his sorry ass eight more times) endings? The sound track is poor and over powers the dialog so you're continually readjusting the volume.  I was not shocked, I was not entertained nor enlightened to anything my desensitized imagination had not already hatched up. If your expecting to learn anything new about whatever this stinker film is suppose to be about; forget it. You'll be better off  wasting a few hours in front of  Jerry Springer.	3
" ""There are things you're going to see that ya can't unsee"" - Just like this movie"	"*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*Let's get one thing straight. I am a big fan of the sleazy and sordid. My user name ""Dr Gore"" may tip you off to this fact. A thriller about underground porno is right up my sleaze alley. I knew that a mainstream flick starring Nicolas Cage wasn't going to be too harsh but I was ready to see what the filmmakers had up their sleeve.Joaquin Phoenix tells Nicolas Cage, ""There are things you're going to see that you can't unsee"". After ""8MM"" was over, I knew exactly what he meant. Why can't I get this lameness out of my head? The pain! The torture! ""8MM"" is a wannabe shock movie. Unfortunately every step down the staircase to Porno Hell is lame and laughable. Every character is a cartoon figure. Nothing resides in any remote semblance of reality. I thought I was going to get the guided tour of Sicko-Porno land. Instead I got the Hollywood super shine, glossy version. Bleech.The spike through this movie's heart is the evil character known as ""The Machine"". Cage has tracked down the Machine and dukes it out with him. The Machine decides to take this opportunity to give a long speech to Cage in order to protest the stereotyping of wackos in leather masks. This one scene exposes the filmmakers as complete frauds. No way, no how, would a depraved lunatic take a break from his beating to give a monologue on his evil ways. ""8MM"" is a waste of time. It was made by fools who have absolutely no idea what they are talking about. 3/10."	
 Absolutely the worst film of 1999		
 Ambitious but ultimately disappointing	Saw this movie yesterday on tape, and while it had some good things, it fell apart at the end, (as most Hollywood movies seem to do nowadays). It tries to do something different, explore the underground porno/sleaze world, and that´s admirable in a major studio movie. But the directing leaves much to be desired, the long sequences of Cage cruising the streets looking for clues, overlayed with that annoying music, only serves to distance us from what´s happening. As if we´re suddenly transported into a rock video (typically Hollywood).  Some of the sets have a constructed, unrealistic look that has STUDIO written all over them. And while Schumacher probably restrained himself, the camera still moves when it´s not needed, drawing attention to itself. I also expected more of my fellow countryman Peter Stormare, but I´m sad to say he overplayed like crazy. There are some tense moments, but they fail to save this movie. The ending is particularly far fetched, I´ll give it 2 out of 5.	
 Somewhat predictable, vindicated here and there	"Plotwise, there's nothing terribly new in 8mm.  The premise is strongly reminiscent of a Lawrence Block Matthew Scudder novel, though 8mm winds its own way eventually.  No essential plot point is new to movie-goers, but the unoriginality isn't that blatant.  In fact, the film can catch you up, especially as we see Welles (Cage) going through the legwork that used to be the staple of fictional detectives but which is now all but gone from cinema dicks.Phoenix, as Max, is the high point.  He has the most room to maneuver as a character, as well as the best lines.  While Welles is purposefully rigid (and thus prone to breakage), and the rest of the characters are generally vile, Max is someone we'd probably like to know and have coffee with.The pornographers are caricatures.  Pure evil incarnate, almost ready for their supervillain costumes to be tailored, seemingly out of place outside, oh, Strange Days or perhaps The Fifth Element.  This reflects story choice: rather than present us with a thoughtful piece exploring the banality of evil, we are given a morality tale where the bad guys wear black and the only gray areas have to do with the contradictions inherent in vigilantism. Some ""moment of decision"" scenes are compelling, but ultimately shallow if you pause to ponder the possibilities that might have been pursued.  You could say 8mm's moral (and artistry) is the diametric opposite of Dead Man Walking's.The action is thankfully modest in scale.  No Jerry Bruckheimer exploding subway cars or lethal germ warfare cannisters.  Just guns and fists and knives and shivs--primitive and appropriate to the film's milieu.The establishment of Welles as an upright, decent fellow is overdone and unimaginative: broken-record scenes of him calling his beautiful wife at his suburban home, discussing their infant daughter (whose nickname is Cinderella), swearing his devotion, promising to call again.  While we may need to see Welles as upstanding, this particular device is done to death.Other plot elements strike a sour note, but exploring them here would require spoilers.  In all, some important themes and questions are raised, but unsubtly, as one would raise a banner or flag.  There is no deft touch thematically.  The trailers broadcast the moral of this movie's story: ""You dance with the devil, devil don't change.  Devil changes you.""  There's little surprise in the lesson we are to take away.  (And the biggest surprise is given away by the cast list, for those on their toes.)One can picture Nicolas Cage accepting this role, imagining that it would make a statement about the violent and dehumanizing effects of pornography. The irony is in the limited and tame content of that statement.  The film makes the case that snuff films and S&M porn are bad for us; it seems oblivious to (or afraid of) the extensions of that argument--that ANY porn might be just as bad for us, that violent Nicolas Cage movies about porn being bad for us might THEMSELVES be bad for us.  That would be provocative.Finally, it hardly seems just that this film (and Seven before it) received an R rating, while a comedy about the porn industry, Orgazmo, faced a possible NC-17.  This latter film's nudity was restricted to male buttocks, contained nary a drop of blood, and its violence was all spoof."	
 Yawn	Nothing too impressive here. Schumacher's attempt at his own version of SEVEN feels staged and lifeless. Writer Andrew Walker tried to distance himself from this project (after his script was presumably toyed with too much) and rightfully so. Aside from a couple of intense scenes with Peter Stormare, the film never comes to life. The story isn't engaging (note to future filmmakers: quit trying to shock us into interest), and the investigation borders on laughable if not just plain boring. By the time Cage's character goes into his vigilante mode, you're supposed to identify, craving revenge on the ruthless bad guys. But by that point you really don't care what the hell happens to any of these characters.The hit-or-miss Cage evidently wanted to intensify his character's arc by playing the first half with a wide-eyed naivete. The plan backfires, and his effort comes across simply as poor acting.  All in all, pretty lame.	
 I've Fallen, and Can't Be Normal	It hit my a day after watching this movie what would have made it satisfying: Gary Sinise. Not opposite Nicolas Cage, as he was in Snake Eyes, but as Tom Welles. Regardless, Nicolas Cage was the weakest part of the movie, delivering lines blandly and never really letting us believe his character. The story was solid, dealing with a sordid topic (snuff films) on the surface. Chris Bauer deserves credit for his explanation of his character's motivation, which served as an explanation of most of the characters in the films, even Tom Welles.	5
 Where are the police	Not a bad, bad film, just ok. Some of the movie is a little far fetched. People are getting killed and there are no police ANYWHERE!!!!!!! Cage does a good job for what he's working with. Movie could have been much better with the subject matter. No imagination. 5 at best	5
 Don't waste your money.	Although the idea was good, the execution was lacking.  This film is poorly scripted, poorly acted, and altogether not believable.  Nicholas Cage is as poor here as he was in Face/Off, minus the smiles and wit.  Lines in the film which were intended to be serious elicited groans and laughs from the audience.  Chalk it up to poor writing, not Cage's acting ability.  Don't waste your money on it.	
 Ethically perplexing	"I did not like this film, though well done and well enacted, for its make-your-own-justice attitude, its moral view that the ""good guy"" can and must personally avenge the admittedly awful crimes he has uncovered. Yes, this is an objection on an ethical basis, but for me a completely ethically unsatisfactory film (or book or...) still is unsatisfactory."	4
 A waste of talent	I went to the theater with high hopes for this movie. I could not imagine that the combined talents of Nicolas Cage, Joel Schumacher and Andrew Kevin Walker would result in such a complete waste of time. Seeing Cage's acting in this movie made me see that he is not the kind of actor from which you are sure to get a top performance. And that made me sad especially considering his towering performances in Face/Off and Leaving Las Vegas. I don't really know who or what ruined this movie. The story is good, in a really bad way, so I don't think that it's Walker's fault. As for the actors they just do what they're told and that leaves me with the director. Joel Schumacher ruined the Batman series and now he ruined a good story. Up until this movie he alone could get me to buy a ticket but that time has passed. I hope it will return again but he has to pull himself together. My advice to my fellow film buffs is to avoid this film. It's a waste of time and money.	2
" ""8mm"" just isn't up to snuff."		
 Very sick and twisted		2
 Astoundingly mediocre	"I really expected better from the writer of ""Se7en"".  I thought the dialogue was written rather well, but was not helped by the complete ineptitude of Nicholas Cage and Catherine Keener.  Cage's constant grimacing didn't help either.  I was impressed with Joel Schumacher's ability to switch gears from the now-juvenile ""Batman"" series to this.  But not that impressed.  The only redeeming factor seemed to be James Gandolfini.  After this, I would gladly plop down money to see him in just about anything else.  All in all though, this movie went a long way to get nowhere."	4
 The worst Nicolas Cage film I've ever seen	After hits such as Face/Off and Con Air, Nicolas Cage stars in one of the worst films this year along with John Travolta's A Civil Action. 8mm is so awful it doesn't even deserve to be rentable. The plot has Cage portraying a private investigator named Tom Welles, who becomes involved in a missing persons case. This missing persons case leads Welles into the pornography underworld. There are only a few scenes in this film that make it not a total waste of money. They include scenes of mystery and those that make you wonder what is going on, and with his family. Nicolas Cage is a very smart and brilliant action star; however, he must have let it slip his mind to go over the script with a magnifying glass. Instead of 8mm, watch more enjoyable movies such as Snake Eyes, Con Air, and Face/Off.	
 I felt violated after seeing this film	8mm suffers.  It doesn't hold up to Walker's previous writing effort, Seven, and it suffers because Joel Schumacher lays on the art direction a little thick.  We follow Nic Cage into the underbelly of porn, filled with ultra weird acts of sex and violence.  We are treated to a ringside seat at of this horror show and I really didn't like what I saw.  I think that's what Schumacher was aiming for, but the whole thing left me feeling dirty.  I knew it would be dark, and I knew it would be disturbing, it just could've been done better.	6
" Not as good as ""Seven"", but it has its moments"		
 What a disappointment...	The film's first 45 minutes drag on at a snail's pace and then, when things do get going, things unravel almost farcically, with near comedic turns by the 'evil porn perpetrators' and sub-horror movie cliches abound. It's such a shame as the original idea was a good one and Nicolas Cage's performance was, as usual, superb. Peter Stormare was most entertaining as Dino Velvet, I got a good laugh out of him and as for Machine....	
 Uninteresting and so sugar covered sentimental !		
 Good script, bad direction	With a screenplay by the writer of brilliant Se7en (1995) and the lead part for the very talented Nicholas Cage, this movie should have been very good. However, director Joel Schumacher fails completely to tie these promising elements together into a good movie. It's much too black-and-white, with an idyllic introduction of Cage's family that actually made me flinch, and a far-from-convincing slide into darkness. Topped of by the most nauseating happy end I've ever seen, and very boring music, this one is a must-miss.	
 prostitute	Oh my, now I understand what Sean Penn was talking about. And how this cliche ridden movie got written by the same man who penned Seven is beyond me. The only good thing about this one is Joaquin Phoenix. The rest of the cast is seriously overacting, Cage on top. Please go see Hardcore instead.	4
 Not bad, but...	Well, the topic was very well chosen, and some shots are really well done. The music is powerful, but there are also some flaws: the rescue action performed by the Cage character is undermined by his constantly contacting two women,something that adds nothing and breaks the tension. Also, the final battle against the murderer is not very interesting, because it is the fourth or fifth in a row, and, when he is forced to take the mask off, there is no surprise! In other words, worth seeing, but not compelling! The issue of the nice guy going through hell for a human mission is also nothing new, although the underworld of porn industry is a pretty unexplored space in Hollywood cinema. The film though doesn't give a different perspective. The porn underworld is simply a subjective hell where all boundaries of taste and value are transgressed, and good guy Cage leads us through this underworld with his bad saint acting that he remembered from his last film with Meg Ryan.	
 8MM of crap	"With successful hits such as ""Face/Off"" and ""Con Air"" behind him, Nicolas Cage stars in one of the worst films of the year. ""8MM"" is so awful it doesn't even deserve to be in video stores.The plot surrounds Cage's portrayal of a private investigator named Tom Welles, who becomes involved in a missing persons case. A missing persons case that leads Welles into a disturbing world that includes pornography.There are only a few scenes in this film that make the film just short of a total waste of money. They include scenes of mystery and those that make you wonder what is going on, and with his family.Nicolas Cage is a very smart and brilliant action star; however, he must have let it slip his mind to go over the script with a magnifying glass.Instead of ""8MM,"" watch more enjoyable movies such as ""Snake Eyes,"" ""Con Air,"" and ""Face/Off."""	
 Se7en, Leaving Las Vegas, 8MM?!?		
 Seedy, sleazy, and poorly acted	"I like Nic Cage.  I think he can be a wonderful actor.  Yet, in this film, he is wooden.  The story may probe interesting areas, but I expect more from the author of ""Se7en"" than a mere surface treatment.  The art direction is wonderful, the tone is sufficiently dark, but in the end this film suffers from a weak resolution and a severly annoying backstory regarding Welles' home life.  While I left the theater understanding fully that the porn industry is full of scumbags, the story had no real teeth."	4
 A film which felt as distasteful as its topic.	"A disturbing and disappointing effort by the man who created the spellbinding and imaginative Seven, 8mm managed to overpower Cage's extraordinary acting ability with a weak script and an unpalatable subject. While most of the violence was implied, it carried the sensational feel of ""true crime"" videos, and left me feeling as if I had actually watched a snuff film.  Now don't get me wrong--I truly enjoy a good dark and violent movie, but 8mm really had no redeeming qualities (other than a great performance by Joaquin Phoenix, but it wasn't enough...) and I would not recommend."	2
 rent SE7EN and save six bucks		
 The most sickening film of the year	"This is by far the most sickening film of the year, and that has nothing to do with the subject matter. ""8MM"" has to be the most limp, one-sided piece of cinematic garbage I have watched in years. The movie's fatal flaws (death by a thousand stupidities) are the pathetic, over-wrought sentimentality, the half-baked storyline and little details that make one realize nobody really thought this film through. (Example: Nicolas Cage's character is supposed to be cleverly inconspicous to the bad guys, yet always seems to be driving a black, police-style car. Is that the way to blend in, or was Schumacher dozing off when he filmed those scenes?) Far worse is Cage's overacting, which would be hilarious, if say, this movie were called ""Austin Powers"". His grunting and jumpy reactions while watching the snuff film were so forced, I assumed he was sitting in an electric chair. I can't believe I took $8.75 out of my college fund to watch this thing."	4
