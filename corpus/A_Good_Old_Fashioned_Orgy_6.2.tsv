 Funniest (and most surprising) movie of the year		10
 Don't listen to the haters	"People are really split on this movie. The haters are all either people who are offended by the idea of group sex, annoyed there wasn't more T&A, or (strangely) both. They seem to forget that this is a comedy, and a comedy should be rated by one thing only: how funny it is. This was really really funny.I don't know how a movie like Hall Pass which had at most 5 laugh out loud lines could do better than Orgy which had at least 50. Just goes to show that movie success is based more on marketing than anything else.The one criticism I have is it suffers a little Ferris Beuller-itis. Am I really supposed to root for this spoiled white rich kid? Once the movie gets going though you quickly forget this and just hold on for the ""ride."""	10
" Jason Sudekis and friends have ""A Good Old Fashioned Orgy"""		
 You'll split yourself!!	Firstly you have to be really open-minded to watch this. Even though the Orgy itself features in the movie, the whole story revolves mainly around the planning, personal opinions and feelings of the characters regarding the topic. The Humour was fast and witty. There was a bit of nudity featured but nothing to get upset about if you're open-minded enough to watch this Movie to start with. In General I found it highly entertaining and would recommend it to anyone who isn't going to be deterred by their religious beliefs or conservative upbringing. There were definitely a few scenes where I found myself gasping for air due to hysterical laughter. This is the New-age guys. You don't have to believe in it - but it was a blast! I loved it!!	8
 Really funny and refreshingly real...	I love all the comedians in this movie (SNL, The League, Talladega Nights, MacGruber)and thought that this was going to be a fun film with a bunch of ridiculous one liners and some wonderfully uncomfortable situations. I didn't expect to like it so much, have it be so much fun and for it to be such a great story about friendship. And the craziest part is that in the end it really seemed like a bunch of friends could actually pull off an orgy and it might actually not be too weird afterward. Genuinely inspirational. With this bunch of funny folks I can't wait to see the DVD extra bits.	10
 Fun, if you keep your expectations low		5
 A great comedy for an adult audience...		7
" Very funny movie with comedy like ""Change-Up"" More people would watch if title was different. I love it. I say A-"	"""People used to have them all the time, what happened to our generation? I'll tell you what happened...AIDS."" A close group of 30 something year old friends who have been friends since high school find out that their party house is being sold they try to come up with one last blowout party. After a few suggestions they decide on the most extreme one yet...an orgy. This is a movie that I think will only do well be word of mouth from the brave people who watch it first. I really loved this movie and laughed the entire way through. I think that the biggest problem this movie has is the title. If it was called The Last Party, or Growing Up or even Friends Forever I think it would have done better because most people are either too offended or uptight to see a movie with this title. I will say there is quite a bit of nudity and sex in this, but nothing outrageous and a little more then ""Hall Pass"" or the ""Change-up"" (which is the same type of comedy this is). Don't be afraid of the title or embarrassed to watch it, this is a very very funny movie. Overall, a very surprisingly sweet and funny comedy that fans of ""Change-Up"" will love. I loved it. I give it an A-."	8
 What do you call an R-rated film that should be rated PG-13?	"So, why am I giving only 5 out of 10 to A Good Old-Fashioned Orgy? For that, I have an answer: they screwed it up. That is to say the producers and the director screwed it up. First of all, there are a lot of funny people in this movie, and there are some great throw-away lines that just melt off the dialogue spool until the simile runs out of its metaphorical fishing pole. And even though we have the same setup here that a lot of successful - if not great - R-rated comedies do (Hot Tub Time Machine comes instantly to mind: not that great a film, but good enough to remember instantly when talking about another comedy which is less successful), we do not have a really successful (i.e., it makes people laugh) movie. Something happened on the way to an R-rating for a basically PG-13 film. I can't pretend to know what happened, how it happened, or why, but it happened. And what you get is a very tame ""orgy"" that could have almost been on Lifetime save for one short boob shot from the lovely Angela Sarafyan. One. I can't remember a single other boob shot in the movie though there may have been one or two.So, clearly, other than language, we have a PG-13 movie. So why not clean up the language and just go for PG-13 which would, ostensibly, make more money because it opens up the movie to that magic demographic of 13-18 year-olds who, well, buy everything?Did Reed Hastings - the smooth-mover who built then destroyed Netflix - produce this movie? Aaaaarrrrgh.no, he did not. Peter Huyck and Alex Gregory did, and they are two really funny dudes who have produced some of TV's best series including the Larry Sanders Show, King Of The Hill, and Frasier. Did Reed Hastings direct AGOFO? He did not. The same producing duo directed the film as well. In other words the fault lies with them (yes, the company that financed the venture might have been pressuring them, but I don't know that for sure). And I'm left with the same conundrum: Here is a very lightweight R movie that would have fared better if it had done one of two things: 1. Gone for the R and made it a lot more naked, or 2. Cleaned up what little there is and get the coveted PG-13. What's there is just not strong enough for either. But lest you think I am hung up on a ratings thing, let me say that the storyline failed to punch up the jeopardy (whoa! Dad's going to sell the house, how can we stop that from happening? And then maybe written in three hilarious attempts to do that – all of which fail. And THEN plan the naked orgy party of ALL TIME! And then, for God's sake Peter Huyck and Alex Gregory, DELIVER THE GOODS! Make it happen, Guys, because what you've done is left a fish gasping on the dock and in grave danger of not working at all as a metaphor for the film's failure! Now that's jeopardy.But we never feel that we have an all or nothing situation happening here. Nothing that happens HAS to happen. And when they do have their orgy, the camera suddenly goes all coy on us. Some lovely people in the film who look good all over never even get down to bikinis, well maybe at the end, but nothing whatever sexy ever happens. And sexy is what the word ORGY promises! ORGY=SEXY. Simple lexical algebra. It's false advertising. And people break orgy rules like the guy whose girl does actually flash the only set of tots in the movie goes berserk and insists that she not be in the orgy after all. Wha? And it's downhill from there. Which is a pity because there was a lot of humor knitted up in that mix and if they'd only have spilled a little nuditynot metaphoricallyonto the screen they might have ignited a minor hit. At least a 7-star hit from me."	5
 More subtle than expected		7
 What a refreshing surprise	"The reason why I'm choosing to watch a comedy is to relax and have a good feeling at the end of the movie. Well this is one of the very few comedies that improved my mood significantly. It was so refreshing that I feel like going out for a drink (it's 3AM here), like I just got out of the bed. Despite the ""ORGY"" word there's nothing obscene about this movie. It has some really funny lines, funny characters, the story is really cool - talking about real friendship and sincere relationships.I think that the only ones that don't like this movie are people without friends."	10
 Waste of time (possible spoilers)	Given the talent that signed on to do this film, one would expect a really funny and memorable ride. Unfortunately, that is not what we got.The story follows a group of well-off 30-something's and their first-world problems which culminate in the form of losing their party spot, a summer home in an upscale New England area owned by Jason Sudeikis' father, for which they pay nothing for. After some initial complaints about the unfairness of the situation, they plot to hold off the realtor until they can have their final Labor Day party which is, as the title suggests, an orgy.None of the characters are ever really fleshed out (no pun intended). They're an eclectic mix of boring people with largely unrelatable issues. Jason Sudeikis essentially plays every other character he has ever played, but it doesn't work here because of the overall mood, the complete lack of actual conflict, and slow, grinding pace of the movie.Unfairness is not losing your free party spot. Unfairness is having to watch Tyler Labine in this movie while Reaper, a show where he actually dominated and meshed perfectly with his cast, got canceled.In the end, every possible personal issue every character even remotely hinted at is sorted out and all the actors cheer wildly and hug each other. Audiences are supposed to connect to this emotionally and feel happy, but it ended up being extremely uncomfortable and left me cringing. The actors should all get Oscars for having to shoot those scenes and appear genuine.In the end, this movie is an hour and a half that I will never get back.	2
 A good old no-brainer	"OK, last night I needed a break. The day had been hard, I had zero energy, I didn't think I could watch an entire movie. That's why I picked ""A good old fashion orgy"". I thought, well if I fall asleep during this one, no big deal. But it was actually much funnier than I expected. The group of actors were quite refreshing with some faces we know (Lake Bell from How to make it in America, Jason Sudeikis from SNL).What most surprised me were the dialogues, I thought it was witty and well written, I laughed a lot. Also, it was not as obvious as I had expected so you actually want to know how the orgy is turning out. Unfortunately there was one scene too many where the main male characters go on an orgy observation mission that provides way too many visual details. Special mention to Rhys Coiro for his douche bag character, it was just awesome to see Billi Walsh again! So, if you're in the mood for an easy to watch, no brainer movie, A good old fashion Orgy will do the trick."	6
 About as graphic as a sex-ed video		8
 An Anticlimactic Orgy	"The funniest thing that happened during A Good Old Fashioned Orgy actually took place before the movie began. When I was buying my (uh) solo ticket to the Orgy, the elderly box office lady couldn't hear me say the title and asked me to repeat itthree times. On the third time, I said ""I want to see the Orgy!""Yes, I did say that and yes, there were people behind me. Thankfully, I gave them and myself the best (ONLY) laugh I would have for the next hour and a half.To be fair, I did laugh at that hour and half conclusion: as I couldn't wait to leave the theatre I got up quickly but as the credits rolled, they indicated ""funny"" finale credit scenes. There were two: the first was lame and the second seemed to take forever to show up. I actually laughed because I stood there to see if they would put something funny up on the screen finally. Alas, the second of two end-credit scenes was just as hideous as the entire movie.And to think, this movie was in limited release which usually means it's so good, they want to slow-roll it out and get good word of mouth out. Ha, well scratch that idea of happening. Perhaps it was suuuch a taboo title? Take that idea off the table as well – I'll explain more, but this has as much orgy action as a Kirk Cameron movie. Ah, yes, it's just because it's such a terrible movie, they might as well make a few extra bucks the unsold DVDs will net. (And that's really where this movie belongs in the first place, if not just cancelled all together.Whewa little bit of ranting there. You would too, if you were promised both comedy and an orgy and got a LAZY script, BORING set ups, DECADES-old scenes and a bunch of actually extremely talented actors who should know better but signed up for another paycheck. The tagline should've been: ""If You Saw Grown UpsSave Your Money This Time!""The story centers around, I'm guessing, growing older and trying to hold onto the past. Sound familiar? How this didn't star Adam Sandler and/or Will Ferrell is beyond me – yes, they would do a project like this; they're sell-outs too. So, when the house that holds ring-leader Eric's (Jason Sudeikis) parties is being sold, Eric wants a one-final-blowout and finally comes up with an orgy amongst friends.The writer/director duo, Adam Gregory and Peter Huyck only ask that you be patient, because the characters will be simply talking about this pending orgy for another hour or so (in a 1½ hour film.) There's so little nudity or sex (in a nudity and sex film) that Adam and Peter throw in a sex-club scene that throws the should-be PG-13 film into R-Rating status.Finally, the orgy arrives. And it's so tame; it's like buying a Playboy and you really just read the articles. Only Tyler Labine seems to want to get naked – that's a plus for people like me, but for the general public, they'd probably rather see someone else, I dunno, like the girls – this is targeted to horny guys that usually leave their brains at the door for this type of sex-comedy.To be fair, there are a few (VERY FEW) breast shots. But nothing you can't Google on your android phone when you're bored when the towel-wearing gang carries on during the ""orgy.""My guess on why the film's ""Big Finale"" was so toned down is that they either had little faith in the pointless and humorless script or they were too afraid to offend. Either way, they squandered such potential in the actors and chance to push the buttons even Adam Sandler, Kevin James and/or Will Ferrell actually haven't yet.I'd say to skip this trash, but it's very unlikely you'll catch it with both the minimal amount of advertising and theatres running it."	1
 Lame excuse for a comedy movie: unfunny ,boring ,and really stupid	Well ,it was extremely hard to watch a movie like Good Old Fashioned Orgy...I just had to stop watching because it was just unbearable and stupid -a really lame excuse for a comedy movie.It's another one of those sex comedy movies without any plot nor any story at all--in fact the worst part of it is that it's simply not funny in every possible way ,not mentioning how vulgar and stupid it is -and it's also pretty boring and endless too.The whole thing doesen't even have a story at all--I mean ,a group of 30 year olds who have been friends since high school attempt to throw an end-of-summer orgy....that's got to be the most ridiculous pile of crap I've ever heard and seen in my life...it's just uninspired and the whole thing is stuck already ,like nothing happens from the beginning to the end of it.Worse ,the humor is very vulgar and illogic in every way--and besides ,the cast was terrible and the direction was even worse...who was in charge of this crap anyway?...the fact that such movie was even produced is just awful.In conclusion: awful beyond words ,unfunny pure garbage ,total rot ,crapfest ,snorefest ,avoid at all costs.	1
 Really DUMB movie!!	"This movie has very dry flat humor and is very boring and predictable. Just a view funny scenes, but really standard jokes. The movie is like dry white rice or like soup without the vegetables. My mate fell asleep during the movie!!! It's very slow in story line and has no character...you're constantly feeling like waiting for that ""okay, now it's coming""-moment. But than the movie has ended leaving you with a strange unfulfilled feeling. The scenes of the orgy were exaggerated and so fake. Also very bad, unconvincing acting. I rate this movie a 4 out of 10 for the effort the producers have put in. But it's definitely not a blockbuster. Don't go to this movie, waste of money, time and energy."	4
 Like a really bad porno, without the porn	I have to say, just after watching several Tinto Brass and Russ Meyer's movies, this movie by comparison is like a really bad porno, without the porn (some tits and arse shot but that's about it). The direction is REALLY bland, the storyline is simplistic at best, absolutely not much plot development and is as linear and simplistic as it gets, the acting is passable, and it 'tries' to be a comedy but it didn't make me laugh once. It certainly didn't arouse me with its naughty content. So it doesn't fit in either comedy or softcore porn category. And I have seen low budget hardcore porn funnier than this stuff which says a lot about how unfunny and boring this movie is. 3/10 for me. Get it only if all you want to see are Angela Sarafyan and Michelle Borth's bare naked titties.	3
 Oddballs	I neither loved nor hated this movie. It was mildly entertaining. Not many laughs. Good cast and production values hampered by a light-weight if not plain silly script.The basic premise -- that a group of longtime girl/guy friends would arrange an intimate orgy between themselves -- was not only inconceivable to me, I actually found the idea distasteful. Who would do that? Who? And would you want to spend 90 minutes in their company if they did? Well, apparently this affluent, and not very attractive bunch of 30-going-on-40-something New Yorkers think of it as an extension of their friendship (?!) and if the characters were less engaging -- the bromance between the leads works well, for example -- or I had, had something better to watch -- then I probably would have switched off. As it is, I stayed till the end.I just can't imagine who thought this was a good idea. Yes, I was expecting a sex-comedy about an orgy that goes wrong but not one between friends. If one considers their close friends as family, its a pretty gruesome concept IMHO.That the orgy eventually does go ahead is the most bizarre aspect. Not to mention the morning after when everyone is completely chilled about what took place. It's all bonkers and unconvincing but just a film at the end of the day...	5
 A must-see on par with Wedding Crashers and The Hangover	This is a delicious story about staying young through our quest for the ultimate party with our closest friends. As a guy in my 30s, I don't like when movies with super-young 20-somethings are painting the picture that my best times are behind me. This crew reminds me of my friends - not your stock characters, but a sweet mix of nerdy and sexy that's especially endearing the more you know them. And as the title may or may not suggest, there's a real earnestness to the way each of these guys (and gals) considers the possibility of getting it on with their best mates. Realizing that the smart dialogue moves pretty fast, I had to revisit some scenes to savor some of the subtleties. Killer casting and great writing all around. I'm going to have to buy this movie because I think it's on par with the likes of The Hangover and Wedding Crashers and it's not just all about dudes.	9
 Not Good	The film is quite funny. But the story in this film is not that great. Sue Plummer (Michelle Borth) have feelings and love for Jason Sudeikis (Eric Keppler), and they have sex. But why Sue Plummer (Michelle Borth) have sex again with Tyler Labine (Mike McCrudden) if Sue Plummer (Michelle Borth) has feelings for Jason Sudeikis (Eric Keppler). And Jason Sudeikis (Eric Keppler) having sex with Lake Bell (Alison Lobel). But Sue Plummer (Michelle Borth) has no jealousy.So Sex for funny? So if you have a boyfriend/girlfriend do a orgy sex, and having sex with their respective girlfriend/boyfriend having sex again with someone else, it is something stupid. Close friends do orgy sex with each other? it sounds so crazy and not good. So this movie is not worth it in for exampleIf the story in this film, Sue Plummer (Michelle Borth) and Jason Sudeikis (Eric Keppler) like each other and have sex. And do not have sex again with her ​​other friends, the film is good.a friend is a friend, So you can not having sex with your friends.unless you love each other. You can making love only with your girlfriend/boyfriend. But not like in this film story. you can do a sex orgy, but only if done with your boyfriend/girlfriend. and not having sex with someone else after having sex with your girlfriend/boyfriend at a orgy sex Thats my opinions	3
 Better than box office numbers suggest	"I stumbled across this movie, since it features one of my favorite comedy actors, Jason Sudeikis. Were it not for the good reviews it had here, I would probably have overlooked it.You can best sum this movie up as grown up version of American Pie - it's about a group of people trying to expand their sexual boundaries and their funny and sometimes awkward way of dealing with it. Yet the humor is definitely more subtle and mature. The actors do a good job, especially Sudeikis and Labine, and have a good group chemistry. The sex scenes aren't more explicit than in most movies nowadays - less than you would expect from a movie with the word orgy in the title.I'm sure had it been named 'One Last Party"", it would have done better. Worthwhile watching it."	8
 THE LAMEST GENERATION	"Eric (Jason Sudeikis) lives in his dad's summer home. He loves to throw parties for his circle of friends. He opts for his last party of the summer to throw an orgy. The gang which is at first reluctant is goaded into it because their generation missed out on the sex because of AIDS. They are ""the lamest generation.""Meanwhile the house is on the market and Eric has suddenly developed feeling for the realtor (Leslie Bibb) which did nothing for the story.The humor was hit and miss, but usually near the mark. There were some great scenes such as when the newlyweds are upset they weren't invited to the perv inner circle. I thought the orgy itself was anti-climatic as the writers needed to have a sex scene, but didn't know how to write one without much sex and still be funny.A me-too sex comedy, slightly above par.F-bombs, sex, nudity male and female (Dee Dee Rescher, Jon Stafford, Angela Sarafyan of ""Twilight"")"	8
 some minor laughs		5
 A Good Comedy with a Great Cast		7
 Stupid but funny	This movie is not for the serious minded, and as the title suggests, not something you would see with your grandmother. The premise is ridiculous, but its actually more original than one of those national lampoons movies. Its stupid funny, and some of the well placed jokes actually made me laugh out loud. I would say this is a movie to see if you its something you see on Netflix or HBO, although I don't think I would buy it, and renting would be only if there is nothing else to see. If you are into those Eurotrip kind of movies, this will be right up your ally, and actually seems to be made for an older crowd which is a nice change of pace.Give the fact that it seemed to achieve exactly what it wanted and that it didn't have horrible or distracting acting, I would give this movie a solid 7. Its not the best movie I have ever seen, and I doubt I will recommend it, but I don't feel like it wasn't worth my time to watch and at several points it is actually very funny.	7
 Watching this movie was like watching a party go down that I want no part in	I just don't get how people can actually find this movie to be funny. I just found it gross all around. Sure it's raunchy, but just because a movie is raunchy doesn't make it good. I was bored with this movie. Watching this movie was like watching grown ass men act like immature teenagers, except it isn't funny at all. Sure the dialogues are crude, but it just came off more disgusting than it actually being funny. So yeah, this movie is crude and raunchy, that basically sums up this movie. The plot is basically about a frat guy that just want to keep on partying and thinks about taking it to another level by having a orgy party. I wasn't amused and this whole thing became a rubbish experience. Watching this movie was like watching a party go down, that I just did not want to be a part of...At all.4.6/10	4
 The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078	Haven't we had enough of this format already? Four guys and Four girls, who like to party, decide to do something wild and crazy one night. There's the leader and the shy one, and of course the weird one and the funny one. This set-up has been beaten to death! If you've seen Super Bad, The Hangover, Take Me Home Tonight, or any number of copycats, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Granted, the idea here is a little more original than most and the movie does do what it was intended to do, make you laugh. The faces are different, the situation is different, but everything else is exactly the same, there's nothing original here. Jason Sudeikis and Lake Bell do a great job of making us laugh, but again it's just your basic drunken idiots out to do something special, with all the pitfalls, and weird stuff that happens in-between. It was funny and a great way to kill a couple hours, but I got an extreme sensation of deja vu throughout this film. Overall, A Good Old Fashioned Orgy is good for some cheap laughs, but it's honestly nothing you haven't seen before.	6
 omg...what a funny movie	this was way better than the 6.1 rating given on this page. i had to rewind many times to see parts missed while i was laughing. deserves a better rating...maybe not a 10, but at least a 9. why is it funny movies rarely get good ratings? the acting was good. the story line was good. the banter back and forth was good. the relationships between the characters are genuinely felt. i feel this is better than hangover, which people raved about... but i never heard a word about this movie. too bad. if you don't rent it, you are missing out. some of the lines are a little corny, i will admit, but as in most comedies, you will have that. all in all, i feel this movie was well worth the rental cost.	10
 Brilliant in every way!		10
 The best comedy of the year		10
 A Good Old Fashioned 80's Sex Comedy!		8
 Do not read ANY reviews if you want really to enjoy a movie! Personally I liked this one :)		9
 Surprisingly funny	Considering the premise and title of A Good Old Fashioned Orgy it has all the potential of being a low-brow, gross-out comedy, but that turns out to take up a very small portion of it. Thanks to a solid cast and a good script, it's actually a surprisingly mellow and heartfelt comedy about companionship and about getting older, and it's a great movie for people who grew up in the 80's and early 90's and enjoyed teen comedies from The Breakfast Club onwards. It's definitely much spicier than those movies - if sexual humor or nudity offend you, you should probably stay away. But it's not explicit, offensive or tasteless and the sex itself is portrayed surprisingly realistically. More than anything else, the characters make the movie work - they're rooted in stereotypes, but they're complex and realistic enough to not come across as cheap caricatures or unsympathetic jerks, and they're easy to relate to and get invested in, which makes the movie not just a funny comedy but also a rather sweet feel-good movie about friendship.	7
