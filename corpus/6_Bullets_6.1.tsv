 A great Van Damme movie...	f	7
 Above Average for a direct to DVD movie, an upswing for Van Damme	"Finally ! Van Damme seems to be getting his act together and putting out a better product. This is one of the best ""straight to video"" movies he has done, kind of on par with Desert Heat and Legionaire, and dare I say almost good enough that it could have had a theatrical release. The plot borrows heavily from ""Taken"" and a few other movies but is pulled off well and JCVD is in good physical shape for this film, despite his haggard face. Could have used a bit more hand to hand fight scenes, but what we are given is filmed well. Definitely worth a view if you are a Van Damme fan, something that couldn't be said for most of his movies made in the 2000s. Let's hope he can maintain this momentum and have a bit of career resurgence like Stallone."	8
 Van Damme delivers 6 Bullets		6
 Van Damme is in top form		6
 At the budget is one of the best movie of last year, my grade is the maximum. Van Damme has an unforgettable performance!		10
 Not bad for a direct to video film, not great either - Minor spoilers	"Six Bullets is directed by Ernie Barbarash. Who recently directed Assassination Games also starring Jean Claude Van Damme and Scott Adkins. Six Bullets was recently screened at Cannes 2012 and here is my Review (contains spoilers):Van Damme plays a depressed, ex military (or something along those lines. It's never really discussed) by the name of Samson Gaul who is hired to rescue the daughter of an MMA fighter, Andrew, played by Joe Flannigan. Joe portrays the equivalent of Floyd Mayweather in the MMA world. Surprisingly, you get the feeling that Van Damme is not the lead in this film and from the off set it's apparent that Joe Flannigan is the main attraction here. Joe is an 'MMA fighter' whose daughter has been kidnapped due to his spiraling debts, you later learn that Joe is due to throw a fight and bets against himself for a large sum which he owes to ""Vlad"". Things don't exactly go accordingly and Vlad deploys a number of his team to kidnap Joe's daughter, Monica. Andrew then realizes that he is in over his head and calls on an old ally who is renowned for his recover of small children. Fans of Jean Claude will be pleased with what he has to offer and looks in tremendous shape when he is boxing a hanging piece of meat a la Rocky style with Joe Flannigan (There are a few references to Sylvester Stallone, Jean Claude saves the best for last which I won't spoil). Samson and his son set out to rescue Monica and reunite her with her father. Kristopher Van Varenberg is surprisingly entertaining in his role as Samson's son and his shoot-out albeit with the rather unimaginative villains is similar to the Van Damme movies we all grew fond of as a teenager and he certainly has the ability and is worthy enough of carrying the Van Damme name if he so chooses. The main shoot out takes place outside an old mansion and the slow motion 'shoot and kill' moment is very similar to that of the slow motion capture used in his father's earlier films such as the Hard Target. Kris also adds an element of comedy the way he dismembers one of the henchman in the knife scene that takes part in mansion's kitchen. Van Damme's daughter, Bianca Bree/Van Varenberg/Van Damme, I am not sure what she names herself, makes a brief appearance although it really feels like she happened to be on set and they threw a small cameo at her to keep her father happy. Overall, there are a few action scenes that we have become accustomed with in a Van Damme film – He certainly displays better punching prowess compared his more recent DTV efforts, he takes out three guys Transporter style in the end mansion finale in a small hallway. Although there is more gun action than fight scenes, there isn't really a need for Van Damme to demonstrate his kicking ability as there isn't the opportunity to do so. In fact, I would have expected more from Joe Flannigan's character given his supposed background as an MMA fighter. Joe doesn't participate in too many action scenes and it's transparent he doesn't have any interest in becoming an action star. He should have been a more lovable rogue than an MMA fighterYou kind of hope that Van Damme has more dialogue in the movie. Throughout the film, you feel slightly frustrated that he is not presented with more dialogue and most of his lines are no more than one or two in length. For those that have seen Assassination Games will instantly feel the Barbarash vibe to this movie, the tone, well used locations and pace of the movie more than give this away. The story is all too familiar in the direct to video market and isn't going to win any awards and fans of low budget, action, direct to video movies will enjoy this – I give this 6/10."	6
 Comically horrible	This movie is not boring, as it is just horribly executed and edited. The acting is unconvincing. The opening sequence was filled with action and some pretty good knife play, but it's clearly fantasy when people drop dead immediately from a cut to the neck without as much as a drop of blood, and of course no stains on JCVD's pristine white shirt. It's the little things like that which pull me out of the story. It's the reminder that I'm just watching a bad movie. I laughed out loud at many of the scenes because of the blunders. They don't even bother covering the fact that they're using blanks...one scene toward the end, some dude loads a bolt action sniper rifle with what is clearly a crimped blank round. Then they show some surveillance feed that shows the rear of the surveillance camera in the feed...what???? Comically horrible. The issue of human trafficking deserves a better movie.	2
 Everyone reviewing this film must be 12 years old. This is a terrible film, and I'm a JCVD fan!		1
 Definitely a B movie...but in terms of actors who used to be famous but still make movies Van Dammes are watchable. I say B-.	"""I know you mean well but your not a cop, your a soldier and this is not Africa or Afganistan."" Samson Gaul (Van Damme) is the best at what he does. He is an ex-mercenary who finds missing children where ever they may be. When one mission goes wrong and he finds the girl he was looking for but other children get killed as collateral damage he vows to give up and no longer be in that line of work. When famous MMA fighter Andrew Fayden's (Flanigan) daughter goes missing he offers Samson a job that he can't refuse. Before I start I have to say that this is not as bad as I expected...but I expected a typical Van Damme movie. While it's still a B movie this is actually watchable. I am not saying I am a fan at all but if I had to choose between a new Val Kilmer, Dolph Lundgren, or Steven Segal movie after watching this one I would have to go with Van Damme. This is a movie where you pretty much know what your going to get going in and it doesn't disappoint in that sense. Nothing to run out and watch but in terms of movies starring action heroes who used to be famous this is not bad at all. I give it a B-."	5
 An Extremely Boring Van Damme DTV Release...That Barely Has Him In It...		3
 Fast pace action with minimum spoilers.	As usual John-Claude Van Damme is back in the action, but this time it involve children kidnapped for human trafficking and all the sick, sick thing involved. Backed by Joe Flanagan of Star Gate Atlantis fame and the father of a kidnapped American fourteen year old girl. In the movies Flanagan plays a professional fighter and makes a suitable back up for Van Damme's knife play and fighting. JCVD is of course because of age has limited his high kicking karate kicks. Instead he's integrated all sorts of fire power, gas and fire bombs. I could have done without one event towards the end of the movie, but other than that it was well acted and it was nice to see Van Damme's real life son playing his son in the movie.	8
 Would have been a great film, if they had left out the bits between the action scenes	It's got the feel of an 80's B Movie. Also, the way it is shot makes it look more like a TV production than a feature film, but that could play towards its retro charm. So much so good, but unfortunately the script progressively deteriorates towards the second part of the film, until the plot takes turns that are so hair-raisingly stupid that it made me cringe. All of this is compounded by a cast that for the most part fails to even remotely convince in their roles. At least in my humble opinion, not even JCVD's decent performance can't quite salvage the film. The action scenes are good, although the majority of the good martial-arts stuff is in the first part of the film. So, beware, this film is only for JCVD die-hard fans.	2
 Was actually not that bad.	I had little hopes honestly thinking Im going to fall asleep on it. Actually when it starts it starts out pretty decent. A few people get there *** kicked by him. The one thing I like most about the movie is it has that action feel to it but it also has its sad parts that make you go aw. This is my first review All i'm saying s this movie is way better than assassination games. I think van Damme starting to come back up there with the big guys SLOWLY tho. I think This was a good choice for Van Damme to go. it does have some nudity just the regular pole dancers etc. I also think another movie worth checking out would be Steven Seagals new movie called Maximum Conviction starring Stone Cold Steve Austin Seagal is coming back to the top as well for being 60. check both these movies out.	5
 Action Drama	Do not watch this expecting hand to hand combat (well not too much of that anyway). There are a few of those, but there is more gun action, than fist fights going on here. You also have van Dammes son here (under his fathers real last name) and his daughter (who changed her name, though I'm not sure, if it's because she's married or just a name change to sound good), both not the greatest actors in the world, but get the job done.Van Damme too delivers and plays his character really good. It's a stellar performance, a stellar script with some supernatural touches and an engaging story overall. This still won't change the mind of some people concerning van Damme of course. But maybe due to his recent revival (Expandables 2), he will be able to do movies he always wanted to do (next up is a comedy in 2013 and that's something he's been dying to make!)	6
 Taken away		4
 A surprisingly strong DTV effort from Van Damme	Jean-Claude Van Damme stars in another above-par DTV outing, and proves that he's still relevant (at least more relevant than Steven Seagal). There's nothing too special about the story, seeing as it's been done before in various forms (e.g., TAKEN). Even the cinematography isn't too unique, and has a washed-out palette that is all-too-common in these types of movies. But unlike TAKEN, this movie actually takes the time to develop its characters and give you reason to care about them. In other words, it's not all ass-kicking and one-liners (and in fact, there really isn't any humor). The run time is a little overlong (by about 15-20 minutes), but it's spent with characters you can identify with and a story that has some dramatic impact. Definitely for JCVD fans, but also for anyone looking to branch out beyond the middling action fare that Hollywood churns out nowadays.	7
 WHAT IN THE WORLD is this doing at 6.1?	"Don't get me wrong. I actually kinda dig the older Van Damme flicks, and JCVD was decent(maybe his best actually).. Bloodsport was good for what it was(a b-action flick).There are so many problems here that it will be hard to pick out the worst. Let's just say that you may be better off viewing this as a comedy. And I have no Idea what this is doing in the 6's. SOrry if it duped you into renting it too.The first moment I'll mention comes fairly early in the film when Jean faces off against some villains in a room. He takes out the lights and puts on his ""night-vision"". The camera bounces back-and-forth between his ""fluorescent"" green/yellow night vision view, and then back to the regular view, which should be near-pitch black(hence the reason for night-vision), but it's not, it's like ""library"" dark, the kind of dark that's darker that usual but no problem seeing much of anything. It's laughable.Another moment comes late when Jean(and the couple he's helping) scout out the hide-out of the enemy and come together to talk about a plan. I prepared myself for this mind-blowing idea that turned out to be her pulling up to the gate and getting approached by one of the enemies, and then Jean jumping-in from the side onto the guy... really...? that was the ""masterplan"".. this stuff happens every 5 minutes here.Couple all those stupid moments with some deplorable acting, bad set-pieces, and an unoriginal and poorly written script, and you have yourself a real stinker. In hindsite, JCVD and Bloodsport are the only Jean Claude films that I would rank at or above a 6... this is not even in the same ballpark.Save your money and your time. 34/100 You might like this if you liked: Lionheart(better), Cyborg(better), and Legionaire(about equal or slightly better). This amounts to an absolutely terrible remake of ""Taken"". 6.1? Hilarious. As a comedy - maybe 5.1."	3
 Not bad but could have been better	First I will start with the positives, Van Damme gives a solid acting performance and shows he is still a master of fight scenes, he also looks in the best shape he has been in for a while. The film starts off with good pace and the supporting roles are adequately acted, yes it is very much a low budget Taken film but holds it's own for the first half. For me that is when it it loses it's way, in the last third the drama and action seems to go missing and I found myself losing interest (maybe I was tired!), usually the action at the end makes up for this but unfortunately I was disappointed. With the same director as Assassination Games it certainly feels similar to it, but as with AG I just felt it could have been better. Don't get me wrong it's not a bad film and has some good action sequences but just seems to lose momentum towards the end.	6
 THIS IS WHAT I DO	"This is another teen abduction/ Eastern European sex trade/ rescue movie. Samson Gaul (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is the village butcher who moonlights as a mercenary. His accent varies throughout the film. His son (Kristopher Van Varenberg) who works at the US embassy, sends him clients.When Andrew Fayden(Joe Flanigan), an American cage fighter's daughter Becky (Charlotte Beaumont) is kidnapped, he calls on Samson who is reluctant to take the case. On his last case he generated a significant amount of collateral damage that wasn't as funny as when MacGruber does it.The movie has a slight twist which really wasn't much of a twist. Monica Fayden (Anna-Louise Plowman) mouthing statistics in the middle of the film made me think this was a 93 minute public service announcement. In addition to beating up people, Samson uses elaborate high tech stuff. He is capable of setting up complex traps in a matter of moments. The movie ""Taken"" has set the bar for this genre and unfortunately this one doesn't measure up. Will work as a rental.Parental Guide: F-bomb, no sex, no real nudity. Women in strip clubs scantily dressed. One woman with large pasties...nothing we haven't seen at Superbowl half time."	6
 One of the better Van Damme movies from the last few years..	"An ex-mercenary known for finding missing children is hired by a mixed martial arts fighter whose daughter has been kidnapped. Six Bullets is without a doubt one of Van Damme's best films from the last few years it's quite fun but also action packed with terrific martial arts sequences but also very dramatic driven with Jean Claude being haunted by a job that went ""terribly wrong"". Personally if you love JCVD's films or a good and relaxing action movie this is the picture for you but if not? probably i would advice you to skip it and see something else. (A+)"	10
 Jean Claude is back and he has never even been here before...		6
 B-Movie	"6.2 Stars? Must be good, right? Unfortunately, the movie is totally below average. It has bad, cliché acting and the usual ""cheap plot in a foreign country with no English-speaking actor anywhere in sight"" feel to it.We all know Jean-Claude, and we love him and keep going to his movies. I find he aged well and is up to the job, but somebody made a mistake when they suggested he star in this film. At no time do you get into the movie, you never identify with anyone, it's all stereotypical and overdone and basically a waste of your time.Glad I didn't see it in the movies, but I hope Jean-Claude doesn't go the way of Wesley Snipes and keeps doing these sad attempts at meaningful movies."	3
 Great and under rated Movie	Really enjoyed this film, I didn't know what to expect but it held my attention throughout. OK the story had lots of holes and not all the characters were as believable as they could be, but hey this is not meant to be Shakespeare. As a good action movie it delivers and JCVD is great. He is one of the few Martial arts actors who can actually act and not just fight people.In some ways the story is a bit like the Liam Neeson film Taken. The villains are suitably evil and I did find myself routing for the girl, along with the frustration of shouting at the screen when she did something silly.But if you like good action films and just want a few hours entertainment I would recommend this movie.	9
 Awesome !	This is the best Van Damme movie I've ever seen. It took him his whole career to refine his acting skills, the whole movie just ROCKS! It brings much perspective to the modern day slavery that needs so much attention by law enforcement in today's age. Human trafficking is so horrific in today's modern world and this movie will help you understand that it is real today, every where in the world. Every time I watch some sort of human trafficking movie my heart just goes out to these girls who are kidnapped and God only knows when they will ever escape, if ever. It is really a shame that men/woman can do such things to another human being and have no conscience of the lifetime scars they leave on peoples hearts & minds. Way to go Jean Claude Van Damme; who was one of the Executive Producers of this awesome movie. This is the only MOVIE I've EVER given 9 STARS!	7
" Van Damme is not timeworn... And more catchy than many young ""actionists"""	In recent years, Van Damme has shown his interest in Central Europe: Assassination Games 2011 was shot in Romania, this movie in Moldova; they are both relatively poor countries having problems with corruption and human trafficking, on which basis it is credible to create high-minded thrillers. The tensions are up high, events are more or less credible, and the very end is witty. Well done!In 6 bullets, there are 3 Van Dammes performing: Jean-Claude Van Damme himself, his son Kristopher Van Varenberg (also decently, in fact) and his daughter Bianca Bree. The other leading role is performed by Joe Flanigan, but his character had too many clichés and peculiarities; for example, he became a gifted shooter within half a day or so. Nevertheless, the movie is a must for Van Damme admirers and others, who may have ambiguous attitudes towards him, could see it with open eyes and mind - Van Damme is really performing, he is no numb kicker or so.	7
 Should have been called 'The Butcher'....	Just lately, Van Dammes movies have been getting a lot better than they should be. This could be partly thankful to JCVD, or he has started to listen to his fans and choosing better roles.I was surprised how well this movie was made, and how good he was in it.He plays a specialist who finds kidnapped children who are being sold for pleasure. When a job causes the death of two children, he starts having doubts about his career choice.Went he daughter of an MMA fighter is kidnapped, he reluctantly helps, and then Van Damme is back in action.The only thing i found silly in this film, was the visions he was having about the two dead girls. This really didn't need to be in this and detracted away from the feeling of the movie. We knew he was suffering, so we didn't need to see this.Fighting is minimal, apart from the opening act, but it's quite good to see a sadistic Van damme in this. He tortures, maims, and kills without remorse and it gives the film a real gritty feel to it.So all in all, if you are a Van Damme film, you will be happy as this proves that his career is in full swing.	7
 Samson Gaul to the Rescue!!!	"""Assassination Games"" director Ernie Barbarash and scenarists Chad and Evan Law have concocted an above-average suspense thriller ""6 Bullets"" for martial arts action Jean Claude Van Damme that is a notch above his usual formulaic fodder. Actually, there are consequences for our protagonist in all the super-charged, high-octane antics in this swiftly-paced abduction opus set in Eastern Europe's Moldova. Jean-Claude is cast as a butcher who rescues kidnapped children when he isn't carving up meat. ""6 Bullets"" opens with a slam-bang sequence where our hero saves a youngster from a gang of ruthless dastards who have nothing but evil in store for the young lad. Jean-Claude decimates the opposition, slashing and shooting his way through numerous adversaries as he scrambles out of their huge house with the child in tow. He has set everything up for his escape and triggers a series of explosions that took out the villains and distract those that remain as he makes his escape. Later, a grim-faced Police Inspector Kvitko (Steve Nicolson of ""Johnny English"") informs him that during his explosive exodus, ex-French Foreign Legionnaire Samson Gaul (Jean-Claude Van Dame of ""Maximum Risk"") was responsible for some unfortunate collateral damage. The explosions that blew up the house also killed two young girls who had been kidnapped, too. Now, our remorseful protagonist finds himself haunted at every turn by the specters of those two semi-incinerated girls. He decides to get out the Good Samaritan business of finding missing people because of the collateral damage.Naturally, no sooner than Gaul has retired, husband Andrew Fayden (Joe Flanigan of ""The Other Sister"") and wife Monica (Anna-Louise Plowman of ""The Foreigner"") visiting Moldova with their daughter find themselves up to their collective necks in trouble when the daughter Becky Fayden (Charlotte Beaumont of ""Jupiter Ascending"") disappears. When the Faydens contact Samson, he refuses to help them because he is still recovering from the previous incident involving the incinerated girls. Eventually, Samson decides to help them, and he creates a lot of violence and confusion for the slimy villains. Unfortunately, Samson pits the bad guys against themselves, and they kill the two individuals holding her and fake Becky's death. A police doctor confirms the remains found in the house where a man and woman were shot to death match Becky's DNA. Inspector Kvitko convinces the Faydens that their daughter died needlessly because of Samson's reckless bravado, and the Faydens turn on him. Our hero returns to his butcher shop upset with not only himself but also his son, Selwyn Gaul (Kristopher Van Varenberg of ""Universal Soldier: Regeneration""), for getting back into this bloodthirsty business. Samson begins drinking again and he hallucinates and sees the two girls. About that time, the villains enter his butcher shop and torture him. At this point, feeling as bad as he does about what he has done to Becky, Samson is prepared to die to assuage his guilt. He realizes during the beating that he takes at the hands of the villains that Becky may not be dead. In the photographs of Becky, she has a bracelet on one wrist instead of another. Samson abducts the police surgeon Dr. Sui (Ioan Ionescu of ""Born to Raise Hell"") and Monica threatens to rips his genitals off if he doesn't tell them the truth about her daughter. Sui confesses to them that he lied about Becky.No great shakes in the greater scheme of things, the ""Taken"" like ""6 Bullets"" still qualifies as an entertaining and exciting JCVD actioneer. Some of the thespings (not JCVD) leaves something to be desired, but tight direction, no-nonsense action add up to a stronger than usual straight-to-video release. The ending is particularly cool."	7
 Nothing of too high quality but definitely watchable.		6

 Best of Jean-Claude Van Damme action-packed film in years!		10
 Solid action from a solid star		6
 An aged Van Damme has regained his eighties knockout power	The last Van Damage film I saw before viewing '6 Bullets' was 'Universal Soldier: the Return' circa 1999. While that JCVD effort was not so hot I viewed it out of nostalgia for the original Universal Soldier. Going into '6 Bullets' I was somewhat leery of the aging action star's ability to entertain on a level comparable to his most popular films of the eighties and early nineties; all of which I saw in the theater and thoroughly enjoyed for the over-the-top bullet and brawn ballets they were.I read a few reviews and based on the largely positive reception of '6 Bullets' decided to take the risk. I am glad that I did. What struck me first upon hitting the play button was the older, time weathered and more serious appearance of JCVD. His haggard, world weary visage reminded me of Tim Thomerson at his prime. From the opening scene, tension begins to build as the above mentioned aged Van Damme sporting prescription glasses and very plain dress navigates the lavish halls of a modern brothel in some eastern European hellhole. There is no nervous bounce to Van Damme's stride, nor sign of humor in his expression as was often the case in many of his earlier films. Here the muscles from Brussels is all world weary, haggard intent as he follows a thug to a meeting with some scumbag who sells children by the hour.I was not expecting great or spectacularly new hand to hand choreography in the fight scenes and boy was I wrong. The very first action sequence is intensely fast and vicious and, I found it quite refreshing. Whoever advised the director for knife combat techniques knew their stuff and it shows. There were no ballet like leaping spinning kicks, nor molasses slow sparring. It was literally quick and to the point.Impressed, I sat back and got comfortable in anticipation of the rest of the film. Overall, '6 Bullets' did not fail to entertain throughout. Van Damme is a former soldier for hire who in his retirement runs a second generation butcher shop, drinks like a sponge and sometimes accepts cash to locate and retrieve missing children. All is not perfect with our aging action star, however. While his character is an honest man of good intent, he is also heavy handed and his mission planning skills flawed. He is an ex soldier who has done unspeakable things for a payday and the guilt he experiences for his past mistakes effects his current endeavors through haunting memories of the victims he has unwittingly gotten killed. He is not quite completely on his game, but still he tries to do the best he can in situations far less than perfect.When the daughter of an American celebrity is kidnapped, Van Damme refuses the parents' impassioned plea to find their child and deal with the scum who abducted her. He retreats into the bottle and the film would have ended their had something not arisen to make finding the young girl and ensuring her safety, personal. The rest of the film entails much kicking, punching and shooting in the vein of most other JCVD action flicks, but something about the violence in '6 Bullets' came off to me as more seasoned, less shallow than any other Van Damme effort of the past. Van Damme's Samson Gaul is perhaps the most complex character he's yet played, and that alone adds much substance to the overall effect of the movie. To sum up, at times the unfolding events defy the rational - this is an action film - but overall the plot worked for me, and the acting of that aged, world weary Van Damme fit the film just right. If you're a long time JCVD fan, '6 Bullets' is a must see as he has definitely returned to the screen in good form, even if that screen is just on your television or computer monitor. For those who haven't a history with the actor's past films I would recommend giving it a shot. You just might become his next fan.6/10 for effective action sequences and a competent enough plot, plus two for a Van Damme who looks to have come full circle as an actor.	8
 Good action, not a bad movie	Van Damme is an ex-mercenary. He is an expert in finding missing children. One of his successful operation results in death of 4 including 2 children. Though he succeeded to rescue one child his mission results some collateral damage. However, he stopped doing this job.After six months a couple came to him for finding out their child. Van Damme again get back in action.So, this is the story in short. The movie is well acted, full of action, story is good. If you like action thrillers this movie is for you. The movie has got some interesting twist too. Sex trafficking, child abuse, government high official involvement in such offenses are presented in this movie.One thing I didn't like: directly mentioning the name of the country. It could have been avoided.	7
 Awful Background Music Which Ruined It	Why do cheap movies all ways have that same style of music in the background? I also hate it when the music doesn't stop, constantly playing throughout the film!There is no need for this, it's very irritating.I had to stop the film 30 minutes in because of this. I can't really comment on the film because I didn't see it till the end. But what I did see is that the fight scenes was chopped so many times. Surely JCVD can do a 10 second fight scene in the same camera shot? If not then he needs to stop making action movies. I hope the next film he does is better as I have always been a JCVD fan :)	3
 Van Damme is just awesome!	"Van Damme is absolutely brilliant in this film. Yes it was in the vein of, ""Taken"" but 6 Bullets stands on it's own merits. I gave this a 10 out of 10, because I just didn't expect it to be as good as it was. I watch every Van Damme film and normally I enjoy them, but this one is one of his better films since JCVD. All of the actors were very, very good and the story was good as well. Human Trafficking is one of the sickest things on this planet and it's movies like this that inform people and hopefully, more people will do something in real life to stop this stuff. Thanks Van Damme for bringing your ""A"" game. It's good to know that even though you're over 50, you've still got it dude! Great job!"	10
 Gritty, tough, and one of JCVD's all-time best!	"Wow! This movie kicks some major backside from start to finish! There are always going to be mental midgets who will dismiss straight to DVD films as ""lesser"" works not to be taken seriously since they didn't have a theatrical run, and dipsticks who will say ""Van Damme looks like hell"" since he no longer resembles the clean cut ""Muscle & Fitness"" flex model or the mullet haired winking ladies' man that he was in some of his earlier films, but those boxed in clowns are missing out on some great action flicks. Unlike Steven Seagal, Van Damme is still hungry as an artist and his enthusiasm for making better, more serious films is extremely commendable. I'll give a brief synopsis of 6 BULLETS followed by why it's a major success for both JCVD and a must-see for his fans. Van Damme plays ""The Butcher"", a mercenary for hire. His current mission is to find and rescue a young boy who's been kidnapped and held captive in an underage sex slavery operation in Moldova, an Eastern European nation not unknown for major underground criminal activities. The butcher analyzes, infiltrates, annihilates, and obliterates everyone he meets who is involved in this industry with no mercy. Unfortunately, this particular rescue operation will come back to haunt him, forcing him into retirement, the bottle, and a bitter, empty shell of his former self. Shortly after these incidents, an American family of three checks into a nearby hotel. The father is a former MMA champion looking to make a comeback in a bout taking place in Moldova. That fight never occurs as he and his wife tragically discover that their daughter has gone missing, believed to have been abducted from the hotel. They look everywhere for her and are told by good authority to look for the butcher to help. Despite their pleas, the butcher refuses to help, his personal demons having turned him into a prisoner of inaction. The father tries to find the girl by himself and gets into one hell of a fight at a seedy strip club. The butcher finds himself unable to sit idly by and he eventually consents to help the couple locate their daughter. What follows are some very realistic and brutal scenes that would fit perfectly into any higher budget theatrical suspense release. There are vicious crime bosses, hard headed police chiefs, sexy strippers, frightened underage captive girls, a tough as nails mother willing to do anything to get her little girl back, clever surveillance methods and trickery, savage knife fights, knock down use anything bar style brawls, pulse pounding gun play, motorcycles, car explosions, gross out gore, and massive firepower. Van Damme is no longer just a guy who flexes his muscles and shouts ""come on"" after getting knocked down and then becoming a HeMan for no reason. He's a real human being, filled with emotional flaws and complexity...not to mention an on screen fighting presence and skills that induce yelps of awe from excited viewers. 6 BULLETS' villains are heinous, the heroic couple is wholeheartedly worth rooting for, and the daughter portrays the innocence of these victims with brilliant courage. This movie looks like (and is) a high quality action/suspense film that can be thoroughly enjoyed by those who don't even like martial arts and/or who have a negative preconceived notion of Van Damme. This is a film on a par with TAKEN, SKYFALL, and EXPENDABLES 2 in terms of sheer audience involvement/enjoyment if not in terms of gloss and money (heck, I enjoyed 6 BULLETS better than SKYFALL in totality and it's much more serious in tone than EXPENDABLES 2 was which may make it a better night's pick depending on viewer mood). Straight to DVD is no longer a term that applies to films that weren't good enough for theaters. It is a genre unto itself, made for expressly such a purpose, and is brimming with more than just a few ""better than theater title"" gems out there just waiting to be seen. Most of these movies simply would not rake in huge profits at the theater which is why the direct to DVD market exists...and that's not a bad thing. The majority of people nowadays only pay big bucks in mass for things like the TWILIGHT, HARRY POTTER, and TRANSFORMERS series and all-star cast films, and the same number of folks will simply never show up to the movie theater to watch a 50 plus year old Van Damme solo vehicle no matter the film. Martial arts film stars' big box office lives are simply short run. Heck, many people just don't go for that kind of movie. Still, that very fact allows these kinds of movies to survive and thrive (many times even more so...except for Steven Seagal who's straight to DVD fare has been wildly uneven which has been extremely frustrating for his fans) via straight to DVD which is a very good thing since Hollywood has a way of stinking up good things fast. I honestly think that 6 BULLETS is every bit as good if not better than many current big budget blockbuster action flicks. If you liked JCVD in EXPENDABLES 2, you owe it to yourself to check this out. There's less star power, less tongue in cheek camaraderie, less things blowing up on a grand scale, but much more emotional involvement and much more Van Damme. I loved it! (PS: This has nothing to do with Van Damme, but THE TOURNAMENT co-starring Kelly Hu is another rip-roaring straight to DVD martial arts/action/suspense film that is absolutely fantastic and definitely worth a rental.)"	9
 Not the worst movie ever........ but so close.	The acting is horrid. Even the extras look staged and uncomfortable. There is no character development anywhere. The acting is horrid. The hand to hand combat is awesome. Van Damme kicks serious tush in his action scenes, awful in close-ups. Facelift much Jean-Claude? By the way, the acting is horrid. He is also awful at keeping his butcher shop clean..... Really? A rag wipe down?? No one on the movie set ever hear of salmonella?!? Hello!! Also, the acting, is horrid. Joe Flanigan is miss-cast as a MMA champ. Even with the scars and tribal tattoos. Nope, don't buy it. Although he holds his own in a bar fight. Once again cool hand to hand combat. The acting is absolutely horrid. That's all this movie boils down to.... Action. Entertaining, yes, but oh so flawed. Watch it again? OK but I need a stiff drink first. Did I mention the acting is horrid.	3
 Actually pretty good		7
 Another Good Van Damme movie		7
 You;re going to tell me or I'll rip your f*cking balls off right now.	Two Jean-Claude Van Damme movies in the same night might be a bit much, but it's actually one I have not seen.Living in Florida, I am well aware of the sex trade, and it is disturbing, to say the least. Seeing Van Damme take it to those involved was exciting.He plays a troubled man, much as Denzel Washington did in the great Man on Fire. He is in the great form we saw in Hard Target and Legionairre.He wins the day, of course. I particularly like the way he finished the job.Anna-Louise Plowman was one bad momma.	6
 We really enjoyed 6 Bullets and we think you will too.	"Andrew Fayden (Flanigan) is an MMA fighter who wants to crack the European fight market before he stages his big comeback. So he does the natural thing anyone might do in that case, he brings his wife Monica (Plowman) and his young daughter Becky (Beaumont) to that hub of sporting and MMA activity, Moldova. While in Moldova, Becky is ""Taken"" and the Faydens are distraught - so they reach out to the one and only Samson Gaul (JCVD), an ex-mercenary, ex-Legionnaire who is the best and whose methods may be unorthodox but he gets results. Gaul has been down and out of late, after some complications arose on his last job. He went back to the family business of being a butcher and began drinking heavily. Inspired to do the right thing, he puts his skills to work helping the Fayden family. But will they find Becky in time? Find out today! We're very happy and proud to report that 6 Bullets is actually a good movie. Without any other knowledge, at first glance you might think a DTV effort from 2012 shot in Romania with Van Damme, from the director of Assassination Games (2011) called 6 Bullets, might be another piece of modern-day DTV crud. And under normal circumstances you might be forgiven for thinking this, but, somehow, 6 Bullets bucks all the trends and is indeed a solidly-made, worthwhile, entertaining, serious-minded affair that is well worth your time. Sure, it's a Taken (2008) knockoff, and a pretty unabashed one, but so what? What the world needs now are tough, take-no-prisoners Taken knockoffs. Not love sweet love. The real crime here is that Taken 2 (2012) went to the theater while 6 Bullets had to settle for being direct to DVD. It should have been the other way around.Thank goodness other countries in this world still care about Van Damme. If the whole world were like America, which seems largely uncaring of his career, he would be out of a job. But luckily other markets still care, and Eastern Europe at least still seems to have not lost their taste for action movies. Yes, we do have to put up with some unnecessary CGI effects at times in 6 Bullets, but that seems to be the way of the world with these newer DTV movies, and in all honesty, at least this time around, it doesn't detract from the overall experience. This was our first run-in with Joe Flanigan, and we must say he was quite good as one of the awesomest dads ever. That was one of the cool things about 6 Bullets, the mom and the dad take up machine guns, hand-to-hand combat and other violent tactics to help save their daughter. Thankfully, the wife isn't a shrill harpy who whines the whole time. Quite the opposite, she gets into the fight with Flanigan and Van Damme and it was great to see that. We were happy to see that particular cliché go away (unlike the Prerequisite Torture, which was, well...prerequisite. Apparently.) We really enjoyed 6 Bullets and we think you will too. It's better than you probably think it is, so see it if you get the chance."	7
