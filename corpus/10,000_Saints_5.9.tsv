 Very Good Movie	"I really enjoyed this movie, yes pretty much everyone in it is screwed up but it's also very realistic. Their depiction of bored boys in Vermont in the 1980s is dead on. What happens after is very interesting with the East Village, CBGBs and the relationships and how they progress. I recommend this movie and had no problem ""figuring out"" who was adopted etc. Then again, I like movies that don't spoon feed everything. I'm suppose to write 10 lines of text but don't want to include any spoilers. All the actors did a great job, especially Ethan Hawke and I love seeing Julianne Nicholson again in a movie. She is such a natural actress. I wasn't big on the actress who played the rich New York mother, however."	8
 A captivating story	"This film tells the story of three parents, and their four teenage children who live chaotic lives in New York.I didn't think I would like ""Ten Thousand Saints"" at first because their world is so different from mine. The father, played by Ethan Hawke, is an irresponsible parent beyond imagination. He even shares illegal drugs with his son, which is really beyond me. Yet, soon afterwards the characters grow on me and I care much about their well-being and happiness. Hailee Steinfeld's character as a pregnant teenager really stands out, the things she has to go through is tough even for an adult. The scene that she confides that she does not remember what Teddy looks like is quite breathtaking.""Ten Thousand Saints"" has great character development, and an captivating story to go with it. I certainly hope there will be a happy ending for the children in the untold future."	
 I like the story and the punk rock influences behind it.		7

 More Than Meets the Eye	"I wound up liking this a lot more than I thought I would. For the first 20 minutes or so I felt it dragged but then picked up. Overall I thought the acting was excellent, especially Ethan Hawke who played his somewhat complex character splendidly. What I really liked was that most of the characters stepped outside of stereotypical bounds. Hawke's character was a stoner, but in some ways level-headed and responsible. Johnny, the punk singer and tattoo artist, was trying to stay straight and walk the spiritual path and succeeded reasonably well. I read other comments which complained that ""nothing happened"" in the film. This is not an action film; it's a relationship movie, and given that, I believe it worked well. Plus, the characters all showed some degree of evolution. The scenery, with 1980's East Village was done really well too, very realistic, Twin Towers and all."	7
 Indie Becomes Too Clichéd to be Totally Effective	"The filmmakers here, Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini (American Splendor, The Extra Man) throw in too many plot machinations and go in too many directions, in my opinion, which dilute the intensity of this indie drama. As a result, the characters here come across as rather cardboard-like and clichéd, and I was unable to really connect emotionally or care much about them.Set in the 1980's in Vermont and New York City, the movie does have an all-star cast which includes Ethan Hawke, Asa Butterfield, Hailee Steinfeld, Emily Mortimer, and Julianne Nicholson. I did think that they each portrayed their individual characters quite well.However, without going into too many plot elements, let me put my ""moral police hat"" on and say I think the film went over-the-top with its rampant depictions of drug use, which included a drug-dealer father (Hawke) enticing and offering his son (Butterfield) drugs. This is right after his son's best friend OD'd in front of him, and after his son was already getting high on weed, turpentine, mushrooms, and Freon. Thus, between the drug use, the promiscuousness, teen pregnancy, and other plot elements, it was hard to really like any of these characters.Overall, a mixed bag here as the acting was strong but just too many contrived and unlikable characters and plot elements going in too many directions to win me over completely."	6
 Indie drama, comedy of coming of age and loose parenting skills.		7
 Straight edge? More like no edge		2
 Fragile NY Relationships	Great re-creation of fragility of relationships in a late-80s mainly NY setting. Performances and direction are first-class. (Watched 8/'16)	9
 A Coming of Age Period Film Worth Watching	"""Ten Thousand Saints,"" is an enjoyable coming of age film about complicated and dysfunctional families and characters in the late 1980's. The film, based on the novel by Eleanor Henderson, begins in rural Vermont where we meet two best-friend stoner teens from broken hippy families. One boy dies of a drug overdose, the other bolts for New York City where he moves in with his stoner father. A pregnant girl enters his life and his rage turns to confusion, and then eases as he begins to grow-up. The film is mostly set in New York's East Village, with hard-core and straight-edge music giving the story contrasting anti-establishment and clean living structures, as well as a rough edge and soft core. The narrative culminates at the 1988 Tompkins Square Park Riots, which becomes an explosive coming of age moment for the young couple, as well as the city. All the characters are deeply flawed but likeable, and the New York period setting (complete with CBGB's) drips with authenticity. It was a fun time to be growing up, but also a dangerous time. This low budget independent film captures that dynamic well. The first 20 minutes start out slow, but if you lived through that period and don't mind course language and a background of 1980's drug culture, it's well worth two hours of screen time."	8
 Yet another movie about troubled American teenagers. 4/10		4
 Hated the characters	I watched this movie because I love Ethan Hawke (Predestination, Tape), Asa Butterfield (Hugo Cabret, The Ender's Game), Hailee Steinfeld (The Edge of Seventeen, True Grit). Nevertheless I have hated the characters since the very first lines. They look like the grotesque caricatures of themselves and I never succeded to make a real contact with any of them. The father (Ethan Hawke) is a moron, the kid is a jerk who almost died to sniff some lethal gas during 1988 New Year Eve and his friend is even more obnoxious and he deserves to die. By the way I do hate movies where the main character dies after 15 minutes. If he is a kid I hate the movie more.As an adult I felt ashamed for the character played by Ethan Hawke: how the he** can someone say to a 10 years old kid that he is adopted in the way he does?! Come on! And Johnny the Hare Krisna? I could not bare ANY of the characyers included Les' ex-wife. I mean, do you REALLY need to have one-night-stand sex with that di**head? Are you that 'hungry'? Is he that appealing?I'm not a bigot: I just have appreciated if Les' ex-wife had sent him to fu** himself!Nobody saves and the movie is like a false parade of stereotypical losers.You can survive without this movie, believe me	4
 A nostalgic journey through life during the 1980s!	Based on the novel from Eleanor Henderson, 10,000 SAINTS is a classic styled drama set in New York where we follow some young and confused teenagers growing up and their crazed dysfunctional parents during the sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll era of the eighties. The first part of the film is really explosive and gripping but the further on the story goes it seems to get a bit stuck but keeps it curiosity until the end. This nostalgic trip through life gives you both smiles and tears while touching your heart and is a reminder of how fragile and short life is. A well-directed and written story by Sundance winners Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini (American Splendor) with impressive performances from this odd mixed but great cast featuring Ethan Hawke, Asa Butterfield, Hailee Steinfield, Avan Jogia, Emilie Kirsch and Emily Mortimer.	7
 True to Death	"The story centers around Jude (Asa Butterfield) a teen boy growing up in Lintonburg, Vermont. He hangs out with his best friend Teddy (Avan Jogia) who is also adopted. His dad Les (Ethan Hawke) is with a different family in NYC. In an odd plot point Eliza (Hailee Steinfeld) stops in Vermont, meets the guys and this suddenly becomes a pregnant teen film (not funny like Juno) with an absentee father and a bunch of people, all well meaning, pulling in different directions.This is an indy style film with the pseudo-deep soundtrack with beginning and ending platitudes. ""Life is like a river and we are all minnows..."" The time frame in the 1980s and uses the Tompkins Square Park Riots in New York's East Village as a background.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."	6
 alternative family	It's 1980 Vermont. Les (Ethan Hawke) is brutally honest in telling his son Jude that he's adopted. Years later, Jude Keffy-Horn (Asa Butterfield) is an emo teenager living with his adopted mother Harriet (Julianne Nicholson) and his sister. His best friend Teddy (Avan Jogia) is desperate to move to NYC and contact his older half-brother Johnny (Emile Hirsch) living there. Les' girlfriend Diane (Emily Mortimer) has a daughter named Eliza (Hailee Steinfeld). It's a dysfunctional alternative family drama and the grimy East Village gets gentrified.It's often jarring when a lead character dies early on. It's also a little convoluted that Les and Johnny happens to live in the same area. The story would be a lot easier if the three kids go to NYC to find Johnny. Instead, the plot takes strange turns into a weird love triangle. The actors are superb but I'm not sure what to think of their characters. They make me want to stay with them... up to a point. I love these actors so much but the story doesn't live up to them.	5
 Coming-Of-Age Fun	Ten Thousand Saints is witty, good fun, but lacking something. I was glad that Jude (Asa Butterfield) and Eliza (Hailee Steinfeld) ended up together, but some parts were repetitive, dull, and very predictable.	7
 Very good different movie that defies expectations but inexplicable		6
 With the death of one boy comes a baby and many lives changed forever, and this film is about the guilt which inspires many people's decisions over the course of 9 months.	"OverviewWith the death of one boy comes a baby and many lives changed forever, and this film is about the guilt which inspires many people's decisions over the course of 9 months. Characters & StoryOn New Year's Eve in 1987, two children's lives changed forever. Teddy (Avan Jogia) died, and Jude (Asa Butterfield) and Eliza (Hailee Steinfeld) have to live with the guilt and consequences of that night. Which isn't solely them both playing a role in his death, with Eliza giving him coke and Jude having him huff Freon, among other things, but the fact he left a baby in Eliza's belly. Thus being the main plot of the film. One dealing with everyone's guilt over what they did or didn't do for Teddy; what they didn't do for their own children; and everyone trying to use that baby as some means of redemption. All the while, Jude tries to mend things with his father Les (Ethan Hawke), and Johnny (Emile Hirsch) tries to be there for Teddy's and perhaps convince himself he is something he isn't.PraisePerhaps the beauty of this film is that as much as it has the opportunity to be over the top, considering it features drug users, upper middle class New Yorkers, and a small town in Vermont, it is rather tame. Granted, watching Jude and Teddy do drugs like they did seemed strange, but only because it really did seem like, at first, the film was going to be about two high school guys trying to get laid, do drugs, and slack off into finals.However, with the death of Teddy comes a slight shock to the system, alongside Eliza being pregnant. And while there aren't any strong emotional moments, in terms of Eliza contemplating an abortion, or seeing Jude and his dad bond, at the same time every moment feels quite satisfying. For, overall, it has the feel of a television program. One which, if ABC Family actually ever planned for their shows to end, would fit just right on the channel. I mean, they would probably have to tone down, or eliminate, the drug use, but otherwise 10000 Saints would have been a good miniseries. CriticismAnd the reason I say the movie would have been a good mini-series is because it drops the ball on so many story lines. For one, despite Les pretty much abandoning Jude and his sister Prudence (Nadia Alexander), pretty much only Jude gets any quality time with his dad. Thus leaving Prudence without her own time to address how she felt about her dad leaving, much less taking up all this time with Jude and not even calling her. Alongside that, while Teddy's death is a well- established turning point, it is weird we never hear what happened to his mom after the funeral. Much less, it is sort of weird that when Johnny, Teddy's brother, learns that Eliza and Teddy played a role in his brother's death, his whole ""namaste"" way of being completely leads to not a bit of ill will against either of them.Though the ball being dropped doesn't end there. There is also the topic of Jude being adopted, and him never looking for his parents, despite Les letting him know they are somewhere in New York, and the film having a scene in the hospital where he is born; us not getting to know Ravi, Teddy's dad, who wants to possibly adopt Eliza's baby, to make up for not being in Teddy's life; and there are a slew of other stories which really make it seem that this movie had more ideas than it had time, or committed effort.Overall: TV ViewingWhile what is given by 10000 Saints is adequate, all the story lines which never are given any focus sort of handicap the film. For while Steinfeld and Butterfield do keep your attention, with Hawke and Hirsch helping, there are times when it seems there are roads not traveled that certainly should have been. Especially the one dealing with Jude being adopted for with Eliza so unsure of what she may do with her baby, it seemed like Jude's discovery of his own parents could have made Eliza's ultimate decision a bit more meaningful. Alas, many interesting story lines, like that one, are just talked about and not explored, and that is the main reason for this being labeled TV Viewing. The teases are all just to great, and what is ultimately delivered just doesn't compare to the many possibilities you get presented with, or the odd things in the movie which get ignored."	7
